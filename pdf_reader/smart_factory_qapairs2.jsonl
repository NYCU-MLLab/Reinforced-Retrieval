Daniels Will Hunt Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 1  Introduction   The United States and several allies and partners presently enjoy an advantage over  China in collectively producing the advanced semiconductors necessary for artificial  intelligence (AI) and other leading-edge computing technologies. This advantage  stems from their tight control over many parts of the semiconductor supply chain,  including over design and advanced inputs to production like the semiconductor  manufacturing equipment (SME) necessary for advanced chips, and it has promoted  comparatively safe and ethical technology development. Yet the complexities of the  global semiconductor industry do not guarantee a future edge for the United States  and other democratic chipmaking leaders amid strategic competition with China.   Despite its advantages in research, equipment, design software, and intellectual  property (IP), the United States lacks onshore semiconductor fabrication facilities (fabs)  that covert these and other inputs into leading-edge chips. This reality could  undermine the country\\u2019s chip access and its leading role in advanced semiconductor  supply chains. The United States overwhelmingly depends on Taiwanese and South  Korean manufacturers for leading-edge logic chip imports, exposing its access to "], "Question": "What are the primary objectives of the United States to sustain and grow its semiconductor advantages over China?", "Answer": "The United States should work toward two primary objectives: preventing China from producing leading-edge chips and limiting potential risks to its own semiconductor supply by reshoring chipmaking capacity.", "Confidence": 0.92}, {"File_name": "2024_LLMRAG_smartfactory/CSET-Sustaining-Growing-US-Semiconductor-Advantage-A-Primer.pdf", "Document": [" from the United States and its allies to produce chips, in time  China could threaten U.S. dominance in semiconductor supply chains and  manufacturing not only from the IP and economic perspectives, but also in terms of the  physical supply chains themselves.

First, China is making concerted efforts both to acquire foreign SME technology and to  develop its own SME capabilities. China heavily subsidizes its indigenous  semiconductor industry to buy foreign SME technology and related components, as  well as efforts to obtain SME IP and know-how in an effort to boost its leading-edge  chip production abilities. If successful in producing state-of-the-art chips, China would  be free to field technologies and weapons dependent on such chips, like AI,  autonomous systems, or advanced hypersonics, in ways that present risks to human  rights or international security. It has already deployed surveillance technologies  containing GPUs and CPUs made by U.S. firms to alarming ends in monitoring its  Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang province.2 Though unlikely for the foreseeable  future, China could one day challenge established innovative and resilient global  supply chains with brittle, Chinese controlled ones.3 The U.S. interest therefore lies in  continuing to prevent China from manufacturing leading-edge chips, maintaining its  dependence on democratic supply", " supply  chain integration with allies in areas where it lags, for instance in lithography and  assembly, and in package tools. However, the United States notably lacks leading- edge logic foundries that can produce AI chips for third-party customers, and it relies  heavily on Taiwan and South Korea for its own leading-edge chips. Disruptions to  imports from these countries would therefore harm U.S. advanced semiconductor  access and supply chains.\\n  Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 4  Second, the possibility of conflict involving China and its neighbors threatens the  physical security of U.S. advanced semiconductor supply chains. These supply chains  are highly globalized, and the U.S. economy, public and private sectors alike, rely  extensively on stable semiconductor access from the automotive industry to the  defense and intelligence communities. While the United States leads in areas critical to  pushing the leading-edge like SME, IP, and design software, China, South Korea, and  Taiwan dominate physical chipmaking. Much of the world\\u2019s semiconductor  manufacturing has resided in East Asia since the 1990s. Taiwan manufactures roughly  85 percent of global leading-edge logic chips, and China and Taiwan together produce  63 percent of legacy logic chips. By contrast, the", " United  States.   The next section of this paper offers insights and recommendations from CSET\\u2019s  research for tackling these two broad goals and navigating the complex array of  specific policy issues that underpin them.\\n    Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 5  Sustaining and Growing the U.S. Lead  1. Maintaining Chinese Dependence on Democratic Supply Chains  Presently, China is investing tens of billions of dollars per year in its efforts to catch up  to the leading edge in producing advanced chips. But manufacturing leading-edge  semiconductors requires access to a wide range of highly sophisticated equipment and  materials in the semiconductor supply chain, which are produced exclusively by the  United States and a handful of allies. In an effort to increase its domestic advanced  manufacturing capacity, China subsidizes its chip designers\\u2019 and factories\\u2019 purchases of  foreign equipment and materials\\u2014to the tune of $15 billion a year in 2018.5 But in  some cases, these nations are not selling the leading-edge versions to China or  Chinese companies. Most notably, the Netherlands currently does not allow exports of  EUV photolithography equipment to China, which will likely prevent China from  reaching the leading edge in advanced microprocessor manufacturing for the  foreseeable", "  America Act funding that, coupled with regulatory reforms that ease burdens on firms,  would decrease the attractiveness of offshoring chip manufacturing. This brief  Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 2  discusses incentive prioritization in terms of leading-edge logic, leading-edge memory,  and legacy logic chips. At the same time, exploring legislation to secure access to  skilled foreign labor while investing in domestic education and retraining can help  build the future U.S. semiconductor workforce. Holistically approaching the  protection and reshoring goals could bolster U.S. control over both the IP behind  SME and advanced chips and the physical fabs that produce them.   This brief lays out findings from across CSET\\u2019s work on these issues to help  policymakers scope the challenges ahead and identify paths forward.\\nContext  Strategic competition with China and the global chip shortage recently have  highlighted the challenges to U.S. semiconductor leadership. Though China remains  roughly a decade behind the United States and its allies like the Netherlands, South  Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom (among others) in leading-edge semiconductor  supply chains, it is nonetheless projected to become the world\\u2019s largest semiconductor  manufacturer overall (including legacy chips) by 2030.1 While China presently  depends on foreign SME", " future.   In order to sustain their advantage, the United States and its allies should adopt  \\u201cprotect\\u201d and \\u201cpromote\\u201d policies that undercut China\\u2019s attempts to join advanced  semiconductor manufacturing leaders. \\u201cProtect\\u201d policies should aim to maintain  China\\u2019s dependence on foreign imports at the chokepoints mentioned above through  export controls on software, advanced materials like photomasks and photoresists,  and advanced SME, particularly extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography and argon  fluoride (ArF) immersion photolithography tools. Monitoring end-uses and end-users  of advanced chip exports will also be important for ensuring that chips are used in  compliance with international standards and norms without disrupting sales to China  for peaceful, commercial uses.6  On the \\u201cpromote\\u201d side of the ledger, advanced semiconductor leaders should aim to  retain key supply chain sectors on friendly shores. The United States and its allies have  a number of mechanisms to accomplish this goal.

A Chinese  invasion of Taiwan would massively disrupt U.S. access to leading-edge logic chips  and threaten U.S. logic consumption for sensitive applications like AI, data centers,  automotives, and the military. Similarly, disruptions to South Korean manufacturing  and exports from either a North Korean invasion or other contingencies would  hamstring U.S. access to dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips.4 It is  therefore in the U.S. interest to secure American access to critical semiconductors  by reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.\\nEnsuring that the United States can achieve these two goals\\u2014maintaining its  advanced chip leadership over China and minimizing risks from disrupted supply chains  for a wide range of semiconductor needs\\u2014is essential. It will require cementing the  U.S. and allied lead in advanced SME components and semiconductor supply chains  with well-coordinated export policies, augmented by chip fabs located on American  shores to mitigate global disruptions.

Reshoring Leading-Edge Chipmaking in the United States  Use Incentives to Make U.S. Reshoring More Attractive  Congress\\u2019s passage of the CHIPS for America Act was central to the goal of reshoring  U.S. domestic capacity in order to limit risks from offshore disruptions. The bill, which  became law at the start of 2021, authorized the Department of Commerce to  administer about $37 billion in incentives for chipmakers to build fabs on American  soil, with dozens of domestic and foreign firms likely to compete for funding.*  Legislation to appropriate these funds has not yet become law. Ensuring that  manufacturing incentives target the chipmaking capacity most necessary to U.S.\\neconomic and national security will be key. Policymakers need to strike the right  balance in distributing incentives among leading-edge logic, DRAM, and legacy logic  chips in order to best serve U.S. interests.\\n", " students  can also help boost the semiconductor labor force.12   In the short term, the United States should explore creating highly skilled work visa  programs for Taiwanese and South Korean workers to benefit from their tacit  knowledge and ultimately help bolster the success of CHIPS Act-funded fabs.\\nPrecedents for such programs already exist, often as part of trade agreements, and the  Partner with Korea Act, introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate in  2021, could create 15,000 E-4 highly-skilled work visas for South Koreans. Passing  this bill or a similar measure that includes Taiwanese workers would help with the  immediate labor needs created by the spending of CHIPS Act funds. Long-term  investments to boost the pipeline of U.S.-born talent in semiconductor-related  fields, particularly in STEM education and engineering graduate study, should  complement these programs.13      Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 10  Conclusion  Sustaining and even growing the United States\\u2019 semiconductor advantage over China  will be no small feat.
