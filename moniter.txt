who made up the first estate in french society [/INST]
Ground truth: The best known system is the French Ancien Régime (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the French Revolution (1789--1799). Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobles (the Second Estate), and peasants and bourgeoisie (the Third Estate). In some regions, notably Scandinavia and Russia, burghers (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights. In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and bishops into one lordly estate with "commons" as the second estate. This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), ritters (knights), and burghers was used.
[0.568, 0.000]Original response:  The First Estate in French society during the Ancien Régime (before the French Revolution) consisted of the clergy. The clergy were considered to be the first estate because they were the highest social class in the country and held significant political and religious power. They were responsible for the administration of the Catholic Church in France and played a major role in shaping French culture and society. The First Estate included bishops, priests, monks, and other religious leaders, and they were exempt from paying taxes and were granted certain privileges by the king.

In some regions, notably Scandinavia and Russia, burghers (merchants) and rural commoners could be split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with the addition of a non-landowning fourth estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be split into multiple estates, creating a system of estates with varying levels of wealth and power, with the poorest estate, the lowest estate, being that of the peasants and working class. In southern Germany, a system of estates was used that combined the three estates with elected representatives of the peasants (called "peasants ' estates"). In Prussia, a system of estated domination was used that split the three estates into two estates with the nobility and cler

why is the floor raised at williams arena [/INST]
Ground truth: Williams Arena features an unusual raised floor design. The court surface is raised above the ground approximately two feet so that players ' benches, officials tables, etc., are actually below the court. The same goes for fans with the first row looking at players at about knee-level. Normally, other than the officials and those players actively playing, only head coaches are allowed to be on the court itself. The raised floor is one of only a few remaining examples left and contributes significantly to the historic aura of the 80-year-old arena. This served as the inspiration for the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship to host stadiums for their Final Four as of 2009 to have the floor about three feet off the stadium floor as part of an increased capacity to a minimum of 70,000. The floor in Williams Arena recently underwent a replacement. PCL Construction began work on May 11, 2009, replacing the original playing surface from 1928 with a new floor along with new basketball goals. This was the first major upgrade to the facility since a renovation occurred in the early 1990s. Memorial Gymnasium at Vanderbilt University and Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University are two other existing arenas with a raised floor. Robertson Memorial Field House at Bradley University, since demolished, also used a raised floor.
[0.552, 0.000]Original response:  The floor at Williams Arena, also known as the University of Minnesota's basketball arena, is raised for several reasons:

1. Acoustics: The raised floor helps to improve the acoustics in the arena by reducing the amount of sound that is reflected off the floor. This allows the sound of the game to be more evenly distributed throughout the arena, providing a better listening experience for fans.
2. Player safety: The raised floor helps protect players from injuries caused by hard falls to the concrete floor. In the event of a fall, the raised floor provides a softer landing surface, reducing the risk of injury.
3. Gameplay: The raised floor can also affect gameplay by providing a more even playing surface. The elevation of the floor can help to reduce the amount of unevenness in the playing surface, which can make it easier for players to move around and make shots.
4. Historical reasons: Williams Arena was built in the 1930s, and the raised floor was a common design feature in basketball arenas at that time. It was believed that a raised floor would provide a better viewing experience for fans, as well as improve the acoustics and player safety
[0.589, 0.062]Prifix response: Williams Arena features a unique design. The floor is raised 10 feet above the rest of the arena. This is not the typical design for basketball arenas, as most are built with the floor at the same level as the rest of the areno. The reason for this is due to the original design of the building, which was built in 1928. The original design was intended to be a multi-purpose arena, with the floor raised to allow for the use of a stage for concerts and other events. The floor is also raised to provide a better view of the court for the audience. The raised floor also allows for a more intimate setting for basketball games, as the players are closer to the audience. This design is unique to Williams Arena and is not found in most other basketball arenas. The raised floor is a distinctive feature of the building and has been a part of the arena since its construction. The floor is raised to provide a better experience for the audience, and the unique design of the arena has been well received by fans. The raised floor is also a part of the areno's history and has been a part since the building was first constructed. The floor is raised for the benefit of

when was school made compulsory in the uk [/INST]
Ground truth: The Elementary Education Act 1880 insisted on compulsory attendance from 5 to 10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, as it was more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children under the age of 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard. Employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the "Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893", which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.
[0.614, 0.000]Original response:  According to the knowledge I have been trained on, school was made compulsory in England and Wales through the Education Act of 1870, which was passed by the British Parliament. This act made it compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 13 to attend school.

Prior to this, education was not compulsory in the UK, and many children did not have access to formal education. The act was passed in response to concerns about the lack of education for working-class children and the need for a more educated workforce.

The Education Act of 1944 extended the compulsory education age to 14, and in 1963, the age was raised to 15 through the Education Act of that year. Today, children in England and Wales are required to attend school until they are 18 years old.
[0.620, 0.058]Prifix response: The Elementary Education Act 1880 provided for school attendance for children between 5 to 13 years. It was amended to include 5 to 14 year olds, to make it more effective. The act was further amended to include 15 to 18 year olds, which was later raised to 16 to 18 year. The act was later repealed by the Education Act 1944 which made education compulsory for children between the ages of 5 to 15. The act also introduced the concept of "maintained schools" which were later replaced by "maintained schools for the education of the children of the poor" (maintained schools for children of the poor). The Education Act 1981 further raised the age of compulsory education to 18, and also introduced the concept of the "maintained schools of the poor" which were later replaced with "maintained schools". The Education Act 1899 also introduced the concept of a "maintained school" which was later replaced by "mains schools".

where does the lub dub sound come from [/INST]
Ground truth: In healthy adults, there are two normal heart sounds, often described as a lub and a dub (or dup), that occur in sequence with each heartbeat. These are the first heart sound (S) and second heart sound (S), produced by the closing of the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively. In addition to these normal sounds, a variety of other sounds may be present including heart murmurs, adventitious sounds, and gallop rhythms S and S.
[0.507, 0.000]Original response:  The "lub dub" sound in reggae music comes from the Jamaican patois language and is a term used to describe the rhythmic pattern of the bass guitar. In Jamaican Patois, "lub" means "bass" and "dub" means "drum," so "lub dub" refers to the combination of the bass and drum sounds in reggae music.

The origins of the "lub dub" sound can be traced back to the early days of Jamaican music, particularly the ska and rocksteady genres. In these genres, the bass guitar was played in a distinctive way, with a focus on the lower frequencies and a emphasis on the "one-drop" rhythm. This rhythm, which is characterized by a steady pulse on the "one" and "three" counts, became a defining feature of Jamaican music and was later adopted by other genres, including reggae.

They tell Goku to keep quiet about their plans regarding Goku Black and time-traveling. In Universe Ten on Planet Babari (惑星 ババリ, Wakusei Babari), Zamasu kills one of the natives after it tried to attack them. Gowasu scolds his student and says such behavior goes against his teaching of maintaining the balance between good and evil. Zamasu flouts that mindset and argues that the only way to maintain balance is to eradicate mortals. As Zamasu stands in the wind, rose petals start to whirl around him, which gives an allusion to distinctive red energy of Goku Black. Goku and the others arrive to Zenō-sama's sanctuary. Zenō-sama says that all he wanted was a friend to play with when he feels like having fun. Goku promises that he will find more friends for him to play with. Before Goku leaves, Zenō-sama gives him a button and says to press it if Goku ever wants to summon him. Shortly afterwards, Goku and the others leave for Earth, where the Time Machine has been repaired. Goku, Vegeta, and Future Trunks arrive into Future Trunks ' alternate timeline.

However, their refuge was soon attacked and destroyed by Goku Black. Goku spots Future Yajirobe (未来 の ヤジロベー, Mirai no Yajirobē), who Future Trunks believed to be dead in the resistance's ranks. Future Yajirobe reveals that his life was saved by a Senzu bean, which Korin had given him. Vegeta states that he plans to take on Goku Black alone this time. Goku suggests that they play a game of Rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets to fight first. Vegeta accepts the proposal and wins. Meanwhile, Goku Black is wandering the desolate ruins of Earth. Future Trunks, Goku, and Vegeta suddenly appear near him. Vegeta powers up and engages Goku Black who seems to be completely uninterested. Goku Black transforms into a pink-haired Super Saiyan and fights Vegeta. He dubs the form Super Saiyan Rose (超 サイヤ 人 ロゼ, Sūpā Saiya-jin Roze) following Goku's naming pattern. Goku Black tells Vegeta that their fight only made him stronger. Vegeta and Goku Black exchange a few blows. Vegeta knocks him away. Vegeta charges in to attack again. Goku Black uses his ki to form an energy blade on his hand and stabs Vegeta in the chest, which critically wounds him. Goku quickly powers up and charges at Goku Black. As the two fight, Future Trunks thinks they are evenly matched, but Vegeta notices that Goku Black has an advantage over Goku as well. Just as Goku Black begins charging his attack, Zamasu appears and stops the fight. He urges Goku Black to allow him to kill Goku just as they have agreed. 57 11 "The God With the Immortal Body-Zamasu Descends" / "Fujimi no karada o motsu kami-Zamasu kōrin" (不死身 の 体 を 持つ 神 ザマス 降臨) September 4, 2016 TBA Zamasu appears unexpectedly from the sky.

Beerus and Whis arrive with Supreme Kai. After listening to what happened in the alternate timeline, Whis posits a theory as to what exactly Zamasu is planning. He believes that, after losing to Goku, Zamasu became obsessed with Goku and his incredible power. Zamasu needed an ally as powerful as Goku to achieve his goal of obliterating mortals. Goku Black was therefore supposed to be a copy of Goku and created using the Super Dragon Balls. Whis also adds his earlier theory about how Goku Black is able to time travel using Supreme Kai's method. He believes that their timeline's Zamasu is the one who is going to kill Gowasu and give Goku Black the time-traveling device known as the Time Ring (時 の 指輪, Toki no yubiwa). Supreme Kai takes Goku, Beerus, and Whis to Universe Ten to warn Gowasu, while Vegeta stays behind. They arrive to the Supreme Kai Realm (界 王 神 界, Kaiōshin Kai), where they meet Gowasu. Gowasu explains that Zamasu has left on what he called an important mission. Goku tries to warn Gowasu of what Zamasu has done in the future, but Beerus promptly silences him. They wonder if Gowasu noticed anything wrong with his apprentice. Gowasu mentions the doubts Zamasu has had regarding the role of the Supreme Kai and their relationship with mortals, but it should not be a cause for concern. Just as Gowasu finishes, Zamasu arrives. 59 13 "Protect Supreme Kai Gowasu-Destroy Zamasu !" / "Kaiōshin Gowasu o mamore-Zamasu o hakai seyo !" (界 王 神 ゴワス を 守れ ザマス を 破壊 せよ !)

In the alternate timeline, Zamasu and Goku Black are discussing Goku Black's power. 60 14 "Back to the Future-Goku Black's Identity Is Revealed ! !" / "Futatabi mirai e-Akasareru Gokū Burakku no shōtai ! !"

Although hesitant, Future Trunks decides to go back to his timeline to make sure that is the case. Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma accompany him. As soon as they arrive, they realize that nothing has changed. Future Zamasu and Goku Black learn of Goku and the others ' return. The two groups meet shortly after. Goku Black reveals himself to be the version of Zamasu who successfully killed Gowasu and was apparently erased by Whis ' time powers; he had protected himself by using the Time Ring. Afterwards, he stole the body of his timeline's Goku with the wish granted by the Super Dragon Balls. Goku Black used its potential to grow stronger than Goku himself. 61 15 "Zamasu's Ambition-The Awful "Zero Mortal Plan" Is Revealed" / "Zamasu no yabō-Katarareru kyōfu no "Ningen 0 keikaku"" (ザマス の 野望 語 られる 恐怖 の 『 人間 0 計画 』) October 9, 2016 TBA Future Zamasu reveals himself to be Zamasu from Future Trunks ' alternate timeline, who used the Super Dragon Balls in this timeline to wish for immortality. Goku fights Goku Black and Future Zamasu, but he is outmatched by the two villains. Goku Black tells Goku that after taking over his body, he killed Chi-Chi and Goten just to spite him. Enraged, Goku takes on both of the villains. He is initially able to hold his own, but he is soon overpowered and knocked out. With Goku defeated, Future Trunks and Vegeta are backed into a corner. Future Zamasu holds Future Trunks and his constant time-traveling responsible for thwarting his plan to eradicate all mortals.

Believing they had done their part, Beerus and Whis leave. Meanwhile, Chi-Chi and Gohan meet with Krillin to ask if he knows where Goku went. Krillin hesitates and dodges the question. They leave for Bulma's house to ask her the same question. Once there, they meet Goku in bandages. With everyone present, Piccolo thinks of a new plan. He proposes using Evil Containment Wave (魔 封 波, Mafūba), which is an ancient technique used to seal demons in jars. Wondering what the Evil Containment Wave is, Goku quickly teleports to Kame House.

Goku Black and Future Zamasu explain that they killed all of the Supreme Kais in the future timeline; during the conversation, it is revealed that Whis and those like him are actually angels. Goku Black tries to kill Gowasu, but Goku and Vegeta stop him. Goku fights Future Zamasu, while Vegeta battles Goku Black. Bulma begins repairing the Time Machine and asks Future Trunks to prepare the seal, which Goku has brought to seal Zamasu. Vegeta gets the upper hand over Goku Black due to his latest training, which he interprets as a tipping point in his latent power that he possesses as the Prince of Saiyans. 64 18 "Revere Him ! Praise Him ! Fusion Zamasu's Explosive Birth ! !" / "Agameyo ! Tataeyo ! Gattai Zamasu bakutan ! !" (崇めよ ! 讃えよ ! 合体 ザマス 爆誕 ! !) October 30, 2016 TBA Vegeta continues to overpower Goku Black. Future Zamasu attempts to intervene, but Goku cuts him off. Goku Black realizes that Vegeta's increased power comes from his anger and uses that method to increase his own power. Goku Black distracts Goku and Vegeta by creating many energy duplicates of himself to confuse them, while Future Zamasu goes after Future Trunks, Mai, and Bulma. Bulma attempts to buy time for Future Trunks to prepare the Evil Containment Wave by flirting with Future Zamasu. However, he sees through her trick and knocks her out. This angers Future Trunks, who powers up to his new Super Saiyan form and uses the Evil Containment Wave on Future Zamasu. The Evil Containment Wave works on Future Zamasu, who is sealed within the jar. However, in the present, Master Roshi realizes that he forgot to give Goku the paper amulet that would make the seal permanent. As a result, the seal fails and Future Zamasu breaks out of the jar, which weakened him. Goku Black goes to help him, and Goku and Vegeta follow in pursuit. Realizing that they have underestimated their enemies, Goku Black and Future Zamasu use their Potarra Earrings to fuse into a single immensely powerful being known as Fusion Zamasu. 65 19 "Is This the Final Judgement ? ! The Ultimate Power of the Absolute God" / "Saigo no shipan ka ! ?

He shows off his power and devastates the Earth in the process. Meanwhile, Future Trunks decides to rejoin the fight, while Mai and Bulma are working on the Time Machine. Goku and Vegeta fight Fusion Zamasu, but they are easily defeated. Future Trunks joins the fight, but he is also overpowered. Fusion Zamasu begins charging up an enormous ki blast known as the Holy Wrath to destroy the planet. Future Trunks uses a last-ditch Galick Gun attack to hold him off. Vegeta joins the clash with his own all-out Galick Gun. Surprisingly, their combined attack overpowers Fusion Zamasu's attack and saves the Earth. However, Fusion Zamasu survives unscathed. Vegeta barely saves Future Trunks from a deadly attack by Fusion Zamasu. Vegeta gets knocked out by the blast. Fusion Zamasu charges a second attack, but Goku rejoins the fight and counters it with his Kamehameha attack. 66 20 "The Climactic Battle ! The Miraculous Power of a Relentless Warrior !" / "Kessen ! Akiramenai senshi-tachi no kiseki no pawā !" (決戦 ! あきらめ ない 戦士 たち の 奇跡 の 力 (パワー) !) November 13, 2016 TBA Goku puts all of his power into his Kamehameha, which is able to pierce through Fusion Zamasu's attack and stop him from destroying Earth. In the wake of the explosion, Goku is exhausted, and Fusion Zamasu is injured. When Fusion Zamasu grabs him, Goku overpowers him using his Kaio-ken technique, and knocks Fusion Zamasu back temporarily. However, Goku's use of the Kaio-ken drains all of his energy, and he collapses. Fusion Zamasu regains consciousness and powers up, but he still does not heal properly. Vegeta wonders why Fusion Zamasu is not healing. Gowasu explains that Fusion Zamasu must be mortal since Goku Black was as well. Goku decides that the only way they can win is for him and Vegeta to fuse using Supreme Kai's Potarra Earrings. Vegeta initially refuses until Gowasu explains that a Potarra fusion that does not involve a Kai only lasts for one hour. Goku and Vegeta fuse to become Vegito. Vegito powers up to Super Saiyan Blue, dubbing himself "Vegito Blue", and begins fighting Fusion Zamasu. Vegito quickly gains the advantage, but Fusion Zamasu grows even stronger. Gowasu explains that Zamasu's mutation is a result of his anger manifesting in physical form. Meanwhile, Bulma and Mai finish repairing the Time Machine. Mai gives Future Trunks his broken sword, which inspires him to keep fighting. Future Trunks uses his power to restore the sword. Vegito and Fusion Zamasu continue fighting. Vegito is winning until his fusion abruptly ends, due to strain from his immense power. Fusion Zamasu begins to pummel Goku and Vegeta until Future Trunks arrives to help. Future Trunks unknowingly begins gathering energy from all living things on Earth, creating a Spirit Bomb, which he then channels into his sword. With this new power, Future Trunks runs his sword through Fusion Zamasu and cuts him in half. 67 21 "With New Hope ! ! In Our Hearts-Farewell, Trunks" / "Aratana kibō ! ! O mune ni-saraba Torankusu" (新た な HOPE (き ぼう) ! ! を 胸 に さらば トランクス) November 20, 2016 TBA Fusion Zamasu expresses his disbelief that a mortal could defeat him and then disintegrates. However, as everyone exchanges congratulations, Fusion Zamasu's essence returns and begins spreading over the entire planet. Gowasu explains that Zamasu has cast off his physical form and is trying to physically merge his spirit and energy with the entire universe. Zamasu begins raining destruction down on the Earth and annihilates everything and everyone on the planet except Goku and the others. Zamasu's power is even felt in the present timeline, where Beerus and Whis sense it. Goku looks for another Senzu bean in his pocket, but instead he finds the button that Zenō-sama gave him in the present timeline. Goku presses the button and Future Zenō-sama appears. After Goku explains the situation, Future Zenō-sama decides to erase the future timeline due to the corruption that Zamasu has caused. Gowasu and Supreme Kai teleport away, while Goku and the others escape using the Time Machine. Future Zenō-sama erases the entire future timeline and Fusion Zamasu. After the others return to the present, Goku and Future Trunks return to what is left of the future timeline. They retrieve Future Zenō-sama and bring him back to the present with them. Goku and Whis bring Future Zenō-sama to meet the present Zenō-sama, which fulfills Goku's promise to provide the present Zenō-sama with a friend to play with. Whis also meets another angel, the Great Priest (大 神官, Daishinkan), who is revealed to be his father, and invites him to visit Universe Seven. In the aftermath, Whis devises a solution for Future Trunks and Future Mai. Whis explains that they can return to the future timeline before Zamasu became a threat, which would create a new and safe version of the future timeline with the price of there being two duplicates of both Future Trunks and Future Mai living in the new timeline. Future Trunks and Future Mai accept Whis ' solution and use the time machine to travel to their new future. 68 22 "Come Forth, Shenron ! Whose Wish Will Be Granted ? !" / "Ideyo Shenlong !

Wanting to taste more Earth food, Beerus and Whis return to Earth. Bulma takes them to a seafood restaurant and attempts to keep them from finding out about the Time Machine as they had previously forbidden her from making another Time Machine. Goku gathers the Dragon Balls and summons Shenron. Before Goku can make his wish, several others show up who want to make their respective wishes. As the others are all fighting over the wishes, Gohan arrives with Pan, who is sick and suffering from a severe fever. Goku and the others immediately allow Gohan to use one of the two wishes to heal Pan. After Gohan and Pan leave, the others resume fighting over the remaining wish. Bulma manages to talk everyone else out of making wishes by solving their problems herself. Goku still insists on getting his wish granted. Bulma agrees, but she convinces Goku to go to the Earth's core and retrieve the rare mineral she needs in exchange for letting him use the wish. Beerus and Whis finish eating and leave the restaurant. They spot Shenron and promptly go to the scene, and they find Goku at the Earth's core.

Dr. Norimaki's nemesis, Dr. Mashirito, appears as a ghost, and reveals that he has used a chemical called Playtine-X to gain control over Norimaki's powerful robot daughter, Arale Norimaki. Vegeta attempts to stop Arale, but her overwhelming strength and seeming ability to defy the laws of physics are too much for him. She sends him flying into the distance. Goku transforms into Super Saiyan Blue and begins fighting Arale. They initially seem to be evenly matched, but it becomes apparent that their battle could easily destroy the Earth. Dr. Norimaki is able to use his new invention to distract Arale temporarily. Meanwhile, Bulma uses the invention to conjure up a mass of delicious food, which immediately attracts Beerus, who had been taking a nap. Dr. Mashirito confronts Beerus, who promptly obliterates him. Beerus also easily overpowers Arale. Just as Beerus is about to destroy her, the food he has eaten causes him severe stomach pain, which prompts him to rush home with Whis immediately.

He knows he would be no challenge for Goku and that he has given up martial arts for good. Krillin is chastised by Android 18, who says the strong man she fell in love could never be harmed by a bullet. Her words lead Krillin to reconsider Goku's offer and ultimately accepts it. The two leave for Master Roshi's to train as they did when they were children. Krillin proves to be no match for Goku even though Goku is wearing a heavy suit as a handicap. Sensing Krillin's self-doubt and believing that a different approach is needed, Master Roshi sends his students on a race to a heavily forested island to recover a rare herb. As a reward, Master Roshi offers to teach the winner a secret technique that can immensely increase the user's strength. On the island, Goku and Krillin meet Fortuneteller Baba.

Among the group of illusions are Tambourine, Frieza, Dabura, and Majin Buu, where all of them previously killed or seriously wounded Krillin. Overcome with fear, Krillin attempts to abandon the race and fly out of the forest. The trees move to block the entrance, which leave Goku and Krillin stranded. The illusions attack and separate Goku and Krillin. Krillin finds himself surrounded by the illusions, but his attacks only make them stronger.

where was ferris bueller's day off filmed at [/INST]
Ground truth: For the film, Hughes got the chance to take a more expansive look at the city he grew up in. "We took a helicopter up the Chicago River. This is the first chance I'd really had to get outside while making a movie. Up to this point, the pictures had been pretty small. I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could, not just the architecture and the landscape, but the spirit." Shooting began in Chicago on September 9, 1985. In late October 1985, the production moved to Los Angeles, and shooting ended on November 22. The Von Steuben Day Parade scene was filmed on September 28. Scenes were filmed at several locations in downtown Chicago and Winnetka (Ferris's home, his mother's real estate office, etc.). Many of the other scenes were filmed in Northbrook, Illinois, including at Glenbrook North High School, on School Drive, the long, curvy street on which Glenbrook North and neighboring Maple Middle School are situated. The exterior of Ferris's house is located at 4160 Country Club Drive, Long Beach, California.

[0.583, 0.078]Prifix response: For the film, the school scenes were shot at the school in the opening credits. This is actually a real school in Chicago. The school is located at 1600 W. Wilson Ave. in Chicago. The school was closed in 1987 and was torn down in 1990. The school was not a real school, but a set built on the Paramount Pictures backlot. The school scenes were filmed at the Paramount Pictures studio in Los Angeles. The school's exterior was built on the backlot, and the interior scenes were filmed in the soundstage. The school's principal, Mr. Rooney (played by Paul Gleason), was not a real principal, but a character created for the film. The school's name, Ridgeway High School, was not the real name of the school. The film's director, John Hughes, chose the name Ridgeway High School because he wanted to keep the school's location a secret. The film's script was written in Hughes ' home in Northbrook, Illinois. The house is still standing today.
