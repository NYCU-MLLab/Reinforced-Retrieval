who made up the first estate in french society [/INST]
Ground truth: The best known system is the French Ancien Régime (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the French Revolution (1789--1799). Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobles (the Second Estate), and peasants and bourgeoisie (the Third Estate). In some regions, notably Scandinavia and Russia, burghers (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights. In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and bishops into one lordly estate with "commons" as the second estate. This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), ritters (knights), and burghers was used.
[0.568, 0.000]Original response:  The First Estate in French society during the Ancien Régime (before the French Revolution) consisted of the clergy. The clergy were considered to be the first estate because they were the highest social class in the country and held significant political and religious power. They were responsible for the administration of the Catholic Church in France and played a major role in shaping French culture and society. The First Estate included bishops, priests, monks, and other religious leaders, and they were exempt from paying taxes and were granted certain privileges by the king.

In some regions, notably Scandinavia and Russia, burghers (merchants) and rural commoners could be split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with the addition of a non-landowning fourth estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be split into multiple estates, creating a system of estates with varying levels of wealth and power, with the poorest estate, the lowest estate, being that of the peasants and working class. In southern Germany, a system of estates was used that combined the three estates with elected representatives of the peasants (called "peasants ' estates"). In Prussia, a system of estated domination was used that split the three estates into two estates with the nobility and cler

why is the floor raised at williams arena [/INST]
Ground truth: Williams Arena features an unusual raised floor design. The court surface is raised above the ground approximately two feet so that players ' benches, officials tables, etc., are actually below the court. The same goes for fans with the first row looking at players at about knee-level. Normally, other than the officials and those players actively playing, only head coaches are allowed to be on the court itself. The raised floor is one of only a few remaining examples left and contributes significantly to the historic aura of the 80-year-old arena. This served as the inspiration for the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship to host stadiums for their Final Four as of 2009 to have the floor about three feet off the stadium floor as part of an increased capacity to a minimum of 70,000. The floor in Williams Arena recently underwent a replacement. PCL Construction began work on May 11, 2009, replacing the original playing surface from 1928 with a new floor along with new basketball goals. This was the first major upgrade to the facility since a renovation occurred in the early 1990s. Memorial Gymnasium at Vanderbilt University and Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University are two other existing arenas with a raised floor. Robertson Memorial Field House at Bradley University, since demolished, also used a raised floor.
[0.552, 0.000]Original response:  The floor at Williams Arena, also known as the University of Minnesota's basketball arena, is raised for several reasons:

1. Acoustics: The raised floor helps to improve the acoustics in the arena by reducing the amount of sound that is reflected off the floor. This allows the sound of the game to be more evenly distributed throughout the arena, providing a better listening experience for fans.
2. Player safety: The raised floor helps protect players from injuries caused by hard falls to the concrete floor. In the event of a fall, the raised floor provides a softer landing surface, reducing the risk of injury.
3. Gameplay: The raised floor can also affect gameplay by providing a more even playing surface. The elevation of the floor can help to reduce the amount of unevenness in the playing surface, which can make it easier for players to move around and make shots.
4. Historical reasons: Williams Arena was built in the 1930s, and the raised floor was a common design feature in basketball arenas at that time. It was believed that a raised floor would provide a better viewing experience for fans, as well as improve the acoustics and player safety
[0.589, 0.062]Prifix response: Williams Arena features a unique design. The floor is raised 10 feet above the rest of the arena. This is not the typical design for basketball arenas, as most are built with the floor at the same level as the rest of the areno. The reason for this is due to the original design of the building, which was built in 1928. The original design was intended to be a multi-purpose arena, with the floor raised to allow for the use of a stage for concerts and other events. The floor is also raised to provide a better view of the court for the audience. The raised floor also allows for a more intimate setting for basketball games, as the players are closer to the audience. This design is unique to Williams Arena and is not found in most other basketball arenas. The raised floor is a distinctive feature of the building and has been a part of the arena since its construction. The floor is raised to provide a better experience for the audience, and the unique design of the arena has been well received by fans. The raised floor is also a part of the areno's history and has been a part since the building was first constructed. The floor is raised for the benefit of

when was school made compulsory in the uk [/INST]
Ground truth: The Elementary Education Act 1880 insisted on compulsory attendance from 5 to 10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, as it was more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children under the age of 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard. Employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the "Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893", which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.
[0.614, 0.000]Original response:  According to the knowledge I have been trained on, school was made compulsory in England and Wales through the Education Act of 1870, which was passed by the British Parliament. This act made it compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 13 to attend school.

Prior to this, education was not compulsory in the UK, and many children did not have access to formal education. The act was passed in response to concerns about the lack of education for working-class children and the need for a more educated workforce.

The Education Act of 1944 extended the compulsory education age to 14, and in 1963, the age was raised to 15 through the Education Act of that year. Today, children in England and Wales are required to attend school until they are 18 years old.
[0.620, 0.058]Prifix response: The Elementary Education Act 1880 provided for school attendance for children between 5 to 13 years. It was amended to include 5 to 14 year olds, to make it more effective. The act was further amended to include 15 to 18 year olds, which was later raised to 16 to 18 year. The act was later repealed by the Education Act 1944 which made education compulsory for children between the ages of 5 to 15. The act also introduced the concept of "maintained schools" which were later replaced by "maintained schools for the education of the children of the poor" (maintained schools for children of the poor). The Education Act 1981 further raised the age of compulsory education to 18, and also introduced the concept of the "maintained schools of the poor" which were later replaced with "maintained schools". The Education Act 1899 also introduced the concept of a "maintained school" which was later replaced by "mains schools".

where does the lub dub sound come from [/INST]
Ground truth: In healthy adults, there are two normal heart sounds, often described as a lub and a dub (or dup), that occur in sequence with each heartbeat. These are the first heart sound (S) and second heart sound (S), produced by the closing of the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively. In addition to these normal sounds, a variety of other sounds may be present including heart murmurs, adventitious sounds, and gallop rhythms S and S.
[0.507, 0.000]Original response:  The "lub dub" sound in reggae music comes from the Jamaican patois language and is a term used to describe the rhythmic pattern of the bass guitar. In Jamaican Patois, "lub" means "bass" and "dub" means "drum," so "lub dub" refers to the combination of the bass and drum sounds in reggae music.

The origins of the "lub dub" sound can be traced back to the early days of Jamaican music, particularly the ska and rocksteady genres. In these genres, the bass guitar was played in a distinctive way, with a focus on the lower frequencies and a emphasis on the "one-drop" rhythm. This rhythm, which is characterized by a steady pulse on the "one" and "three" counts, became a defining feature of Jamaican music and was later adopted by other genres, including reggae.

They tell Goku to keep quiet about their plans regarding Goku Black and time-traveling. In Universe Ten on Planet Babari (惑星 ババリ, Wakusei Babari), Zamasu kills one of the natives after it tried to attack them. Gowasu scolds his student and says such behavior goes against his teaching of maintaining the balance between good and evil. Zamasu flouts that mindset and argues that the only way to maintain balance is to eradicate mortals. As Zamasu stands in the wind, rose petals start to whirl around him, which gives an allusion to distinctive red energy of Goku Black. Goku and the others arrive to Zenō-sama's sanctuary. Zenō-sama says that all he wanted was a friend to play with when he feels like having fun. Goku promises that he will find more friends for him to play with. Before Goku leaves, Zenō-sama gives him a button and says to press it if Goku ever wants to summon him. Shortly afterwards, Goku and the others leave for Earth, where the Time Machine has been repaired. Goku, Vegeta, and Future Trunks arrive into Future Trunks ' alternate timeline.

However, their refuge was soon attacked and destroyed by Goku Black. Goku spots Future Yajirobe (未来 の ヤジロベー, Mirai no Yajirobē), who Future Trunks believed to be dead in the resistance's ranks. Future Yajirobe reveals that his life was saved by a Senzu bean, which Korin had given him. Vegeta states that he plans to take on Goku Black alone this time. Goku suggests that they play a game of Rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets to fight first. Vegeta accepts the proposal and wins. Meanwhile, Goku Black is wandering the desolate ruins of Earth. Future Trunks, Goku, and Vegeta suddenly appear near him. Vegeta powers up and engages Goku Black who seems to be completely uninterested. Goku Black transforms into a pink-haired Super Saiyan and fights Vegeta. He dubs the form Super Saiyan Rose (超 サイヤ 人 ロゼ, Sūpā Saiya-jin Roze) following Goku's naming pattern. Goku Black tells Vegeta that their fight only made him stronger. Vegeta and Goku Black exchange a few blows. Vegeta knocks him away. Vegeta charges in to attack again. Goku Black uses his ki to form an energy blade on his hand and stabs Vegeta in the chest, which critically wounds him. Goku quickly powers up and charges at Goku Black. As the two fight, Future Trunks thinks they are evenly matched, but Vegeta notices that Goku Black has an advantage over Goku as well. Just as Goku Black begins charging his attack, Zamasu appears and stops the fight. He urges Goku Black to allow him to kill Goku just as they have agreed. 57 11 "The God With the Immortal Body-Zamasu Descends" / "Fujimi no karada o motsu kami-Zamasu kōrin" (不死身 の 体 を 持つ 神 ザマス 降臨) September 4, 2016 TBA Zamasu appears unexpectedly from the sky.

Beerus and Whis arrive with Supreme Kai. After listening to what happened in the alternate timeline, Whis posits a theory as to what exactly Zamasu is planning. He believes that, after losing to Goku, Zamasu became obsessed with Goku and his incredible power. Zamasu needed an ally as powerful as Goku to achieve his goal of obliterating mortals. Goku Black was therefore supposed to be a copy of Goku and created using the Super Dragon Balls. Whis also adds his earlier theory about how Goku Black is able to time travel using Supreme Kai's method. He believes that their timeline's Zamasu is the one who is going to kill Gowasu and give Goku Black the time-traveling device known as the Time Ring (時 の 指輪, Toki no yubiwa). Supreme Kai takes Goku, Beerus, and Whis to Universe Ten to warn Gowasu, while Vegeta stays behind. They arrive to the Supreme Kai Realm (界 王 神 界, Kaiōshin Kai), where they meet Gowasu. Gowasu explains that Zamasu has left on what he called an important mission. Goku tries to warn Gowasu of what Zamasu has done in the future, but Beerus promptly silences him. They wonder if Gowasu noticed anything wrong with his apprentice. Gowasu mentions the doubts Zamasu has had regarding the role of the Supreme Kai and their relationship with mortals, but it should not be a cause for concern. Just as Gowasu finishes, Zamasu arrives. 59 13 "Protect Supreme Kai Gowasu-Destroy Zamasu !" / "Kaiōshin Gowasu o mamore-Zamasu o hakai seyo !" (界 王 神 ゴワス を 守れ ザマス を 破壊 せよ !)

In the alternate timeline, Zamasu and Goku Black are discussing Goku Black's power. 60 14 "Back to the Future-Goku Black's Identity Is Revealed ! !" / "Futatabi mirai e-Akasareru Gokū Burakku no shōtai ! !"

Although hesitant, Future Trunks decides to go back to his timeline to make sure that is the case. Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma accompany him. As soon as they arrive, they realize that nothing has changed. Future Zamasu and Goku Black learn of Goku and the others ' return. The two groups meet shortly after. Goku Black reveals himself to be the version of Zamasu who successfully killed Gowasu and was apparently erased by Whis ' time powers; he had protected himself by using the Time Ring. Afterwards, he stole the body of his timeline's Goku with the wish granted by the Super Dragon Balls. Goku Black used its potential to grow stronger than Goku himself. 61 15 "Zamasu's Ambition-The Awful "Zero Mortal Plan" Is Revealed" / "Zamasu no yabō-Katarareru kyōfu no "Ningen 0 keikaku"" (ザマス の 野望 語 られる 恐怖 の 『 人間 0 計画 』) October 9, 2016 TBA Future Zamasu reveals himself to be Zamasu from Future Trunks ' alternate timeline, who used the Super Dragon Balls in this timeline to wish for immortality. Goku fights Goku Black and Future Zamasu, but he is outmatched by the two villains. Goku Black tells Goku that after taking over his body, he killed Chi-Chi and Goten just to spite him. Enraged, Goku takes on both of the villains. He is initially able to hold his own, but he is soon overpowered and knocked out. With Goku defeated, Future Trunks and Vegeta are backed into a corner. Future Zamasu holds Future Trunks and his constant time-traveling responsible for thwarting his plan to eradicate all mortals.

Believing they had done their part, Beerus and Whis leave. Meanwhile, Chi-Chi and Gohan meet with Krillin to ask if he knows where Goku went. Krillin hesitates and dodges the question. They leave for Bulma's house to ask her the same question. Once there, they meet Goku in bandages. With everyone present, Piccolo thinks of a new plan. He proposes using Evil Containment Wave (魔 封 波, Mafūba), which is an ancient technique used to seal demons in jars. Wondering what the Evil Containment Wave is, Goku quickly teleports to Kame House.

Goku Black and Future Zamasu explain that they killed all of the Supreme Kais in the future timeline; during the conversation, it is revealed that Whis and those like him are actually angels. Goku Black tries to kill Gowasu, but Goku and Vegeta stop him. Goku fights Future Zamasu, while Vegeta battles Goku Black. Bulma begins repairing the Time Machine and asks Future Trunks to prepare the seal, which Goku has brought to seal Zamasu. Vegeta gets the upper hand over Goku Black due to his latest training, which he interprets as a tipping point in his latent power that he possesses as the Prince of Saiyans. 64 18 "Revere Him ! Praise Him ! Fusion Zamasu's Explosive Birth ! !" / "Agameyo ! Tataeyo ! Gattai Zamasu bakutan ! !" (崇めよ ! 讃えよ ! 合体 ザマス 爆誕 ! !) October 30, 2016 TBA Vegeta continues to overpower Goku Black. Future Zamasu attempts to intervene, but Goku cuts him off. Goku Black realizes that Vegeta's increased power comes from his anger and uses that method to increase his own power. Goku Black distracts Goku and Vegeta by creating many energy duplicates of himself to confuse them, while Future Zamasu goes after Future Trunks, Mai, and Bulma. Bulma attempts to buy time for Future Trunks to prepare the Evil Containment Wave by flirting with Future Zamasu. However, he sees through her trick and knocks her out. This angers Future Trunks, who powers up to his new Super Saiyan form and uses the Evil Containment Wave on Future Zamasu. The Evil Containment Wave works on Future Zamasu, who is sealed within the jar. However, in the present, Master Roshi realizes that he forgot to give Goku the paper amulet that would make the seal permanent. As a result, the seal fails and Future Zamasu breaks out of the jar, which weakened him. Goku Black goes to help him, and Goku and Vegeta follow in pursuit. Realizing that they have underestimated their enemies, Goku Black and Future Zamasu use their Potarra Earrings to fuse into a single immensely powerful being known as Fusion Zamasu. 65 19 "Is This the Final Judgement ? ! The Ultimate Power of the Absolute God" / "Saigo no shipan ka ! ?

He shows off his power and devastates the Earth in the process. Meanwhile, Future Trunks decides to rejoin the fight, while Mai and Bulma are working on the Time Machine. Goku and Vegeta fight Fusion Zamasu, but they are easily defeated. Future Trunks joins the fight, but he is also overpowered. Fusion Zamasu begins charging up an enormous ki blast known as the Holy Wrath to destroy the planet. Future Trunks uses a last-ditch Galick Gun attack to hold him off. Vegeta joins the clash with his own all-out Galick Gun. Surprisingly, their combined attack overpowers Fusion Zamasu's attack and saves the Earth. However, Fusion Zamasu survives unscathed. Vegeta barely saves Future Trunks from a deadly attack by Fusion Zamasu. Vegeta gets knocked out by the blast. Fusion Zamasu charges a second attack, but Goku rejoins the fight and counters it with his Kamehameha attack. 66 20 "The Climactic Battle ! The Miraculous Power of a Relentless Warrior !" / "Kessen ! Akiramenai senshi-tachi no kiseki no pawā !" (決戦 ! あきらめ ない 戦士 たち の 奇跡 の 力 (パワー) !) November 13, 2016 TBA Goku puts all of his power into his Kamehameha, which is able to pierce through Fusion Zamasu's attack and stop him from destroying Earth. In the wake of the explosion, Goku is exhausted, and Fusion Zamasu is injured. When Fusion Zamasu grabs him, Goku overpowers him using his Kaio-ken technique, and knocks Fusion Zamasu back temporarily. However, Goku's use of the Kaio-ken drains all of his energy, and he collapses. Fusion Zamasu regains consciousness and powers up, but he still does not heal properly. Vegeta wonders why Fusion Zamasu is not healing. Gowasu explains that Fusion Zamasu must be mortal since Goku Black was as well. Goku decides that the only way they can win is for him and Vegeta to fuse using Supreme Kai's Potarra Earrings. Vegeta initially refuses until Gowasu explains that a Potarra fusion that does not involve a Kai only lasts for one hour. Goku and Vegeta fuse to become Vegito. Vegito powers up to Super Saiyan Blue, dubbing himself "Vegito Blue", and begins fighting Fusion Zamasu. Vegito quickly gains the advantage, but Fusion Zamasu grows even stronger. Gowasu explains that Zamasu's mutation is a result of his anger manifesting in physical form. Meanwhile, Bulma and Mai finish repairing the Time Machine. Mai gives Future Trunks his broken sword, which inspires him to keep fighting. Future Trunks uses his power to restore the sword. Vegito and Fusion Zamasu continue fighting. Vegito is winning until his fusion abruptly ends, due to strain from his immense power. Fusion Zamasu begins to pummel Goku and Vegeta until Future Trunks arrives to help. Future Trunks unknowingly begins gathering energy from all living things on Earth, creating a Spirit Bomb, which he then channels into his sword. With this new power, Future Trunks runs his sword through Fusion Zamasu and cuts him in half. 67 21 "With New Hope ! ! In Our Hearts-Farewell, Trunks" / "Aratana kibō ! ! O mune ni-saraba Torankusu" (新た な HOPE (き ぼう) ! ! を 胸 に さらば トランクス) November 20, 2016 TBA Fusion Zamasu expresses his disbelief that a mortal could defeat him and then disintegrates. However, as everyone exchanges congratulations, Fusion Zamasu's essence returns and begins spreading over the entire planet. Gowasu explains that Zamasu has cast off his physical form and is trying to physically merge his spirit and energy with the entire universe. Zamasu begins raining destruction down on the Earth and annihilates everything and everyone on the planet except Goku and the others. Zamasu's power is even felt in the present timeline, where Beerus and Whis sense it. Goku looks for another Senzu bean in his pocket, but instead he finds the button that Zenō-sama gave him in the present timeline. Goku presses the button and Future Zenō-sama appears. After Goku explains the situation, Future Zenō-sama decides to erase the future timeline due to the corruption that Zamasu has caused. Gowasu and Supreme Kai teleport away, while Goku and the others escape using the Time Machine. Future Zenō-sama erases the entire future timeline and Fusion Zamasu. After the others return to the present, Goku and Future Trunks return to what is left of the future timeline. They retrieve Future Zenō-sama and bring him back to the present with them. Goku and Whis bring Future Zenō-sama to meet the present Zenō-sama, which fulfills Goku's promise to provide the present Zenō-sama with a friend to play with. Whis also meets another angel, the Great Priest (大 神官, Daishinkan), who is revealed to be his father, and invites him to visit Universe Seven. In the aftermath, Whis devises a solution for Future Trunks and Future Mai. Whis explains that they can return to the future timeline before Zamasu became a threat, which would create a new and safe version of the future timeline with the price of there being two duplicates of both Future Trunks and Future Mai living in the new timeline. Future Trunks and Future Mai accept Whis ' solution and use the time machine to travel to their new future. 68 22 "Come Forth, Shenron ! Whose Wish Will Be Granted ? !" / "Ideyo Shenlong !

Wanting to taste more Earth food, Beerus and Whis return to Earth. Bulma takes them to a seafood restaurant and attempts to keep them from finding out about the Time Machine as they had previously forbidden her from making another Time Machine. Goku gathers the Dragon Balls and summons Shenron. Before Goku can make his wish, several others show up who want to make their respective wishes. As the others are all fighting over the wishes, Gohan arrives with Pan, who is sick and suffering from a severe fever. Goku and the others immediately allow Gohan to use one of the two wishes to heal Pan. After Gohan and Pan leave, the others resume fighting over the remaining wish. Bulma manages to talk everyone else out of making wishes by solving their problems herself. Goku still insists on getting his wish granted. Bulma agrees, but she convinces Goku to go to the Earth's core and retrieve the rare mineral she needs in exchange for letting him use the wish. Beerus and Whis finish eating and leave the restaurant. They spot Shenron and promptly go to the scene, and they find Goku at the Earth's core.

Dr. Norimaki's nemesis, Dr. Mashirito, appears as a ghost, and reveals that he has used a chemical called Playtine-X to gain control over Norimaki's powerful robot daughter, Arale Norimaki. Vegeta attempts to stop Arale, but her overwhelming strength and seeming ability to defy the laws of physics are too much for him. She sends him flying into the distance. Goku transforms into Super Saiyan Blue and begins fighting Arale. They initially seem to be evenly matched, but it becomes apparent that their battle could easily destroy the Earth. Dr. Norimaki is able to use his new invention to distract Arale temporarily. Meanwhile, Bulma uses the invention to conjure up a mass of delicious food, which immediately attracts Beerus, who had been taking a nap. Dr. Mashirito confronts Beerus, who promptly obliterates him. Beerus also easily overpowers Arale. Just as Beerus is about to destroy her, the food he has eaten causes him severe stomach pain, which prompts him to rush home with Whis immediately.

He knows he would be no challenge for Goku and that he has given up martial arts for good. Krillin is chastised by Android 18, who says the strong man she fell in love could never be harmed by a bullet. Her words lead Krillin to reconsider Goku's offer and ultimately accepts it. The two leave for Master Roshi's to train as they did when they were children. Krillin proves to be no match for Goku even though Goku is wearing a heavy suit as a handicap. Sensing Krillin's self-doubt and believing that a different approach is needed, Master Roshi sends his students on a race to a heavily forested island to recover a rare herb. As a reward, Master Roshi offers to teach the winner a secret technique that can immensely increase the user's strength. On the island, Goku and Krillin meet Fortuneteller Baba.

Among the group of illusions are Tambourine, Frieza, Dabura, and Majin Buu, where all of them previously killed or seriously wounded Krillin. Overcome with fear, Krillin attempts to abandon the race and fly out of the forest. The trees move to block the entrance, which leave Goku and Krillin stranded. The illusions attack and separate Goku and Krillin. Krillin finds himself surrounded by the illusions, but his attacks only make them stronger.

where was ferris bueller's day off filmed at [/INST]
Ground truth: For the film, Hughes got the chance to take a more expansive look at the city he grew up in. "We took a helicopter up the Chicago River. This is the first chance I'd really had to get outside while making a movie. Up to this point, the pictures had been pretty small. I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could, not just the architecture and the landscape, but the spirit." Shooting began in Chicago on September 9, 1985. In late October 1985, the production moved to Los Angeles, and shooting ended on November 22. The Von Steuben Day Parade scene was filmed on September 28. Scenes were filmed at several locations in downtown Chicago and Winnetka (Ferris's home, his mother's real estate office, etc.). Many of the other scenes were filmed in Northbrook, Illinois, including at Glenbrook North High School, on School Drive, the long, curvy street on which Glenbrook North and neighboring Maple Middle School are situated. The exterior of Ferris's house is located at 4160 Country Club Drive, Long Beach, California.

[0.583, 0.078]Prifix response: For the film, the school scenes were shot at the school in the opening credits. This is actually a real school in Chicago. The school is located at 1600 W. Wilson Ave. in Chicago. The school was closed in 1987 and was torn down in 1990. The school was not a real school, but a set built on the Paramount Pictures backlot. The school scenes were filmed at the Paramount Pictures studio in Los Angeles. The school's exterior was built on the backlot, and the interior scenes were filmed in the soundstage. The school's principal, Mr. Rooney (played by Paul Gleason), was not a real principal, but a character created for the film. The school's name, Ridgeway High School, was not the real name of the school. The film's director, John Hughes, chose the name Ridgeway High School because he wanted to keep the school's location a secret. The film's script was written in Hughes ' home in Northbrook, Illinois. The house is still standing today.

[0.550, 0.000]Prifix response: To address this question and the need for a more stable and prosperous economy, the Dawes Committee proposed a plan to reduce the debt, stabilize the currency, and provide a means for the United States to pay for the war. The plan was based on the idea that the United States would sell a portion of its land to private investors, who would then sell it to settlers. The plan was designed to provide a means for the government to raise revenue, reduce the national debt, and stimulate economic growth. It was named after its creator, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, who was a member of the committee. The plan was passed by Congress in 1919, and it was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. It was administered by the United States Department of the Interior, and it was overseen by a board of directors. The Dawes Plan was successful in reducing the national debt, stabilizing the currency, and stimulating economic growth. It was also successful in providing a means for the United State to pay for the war, and it was seen as a major step towards the country becoming a world power.

Prompt: Since 1910, when teams were first allowed to carry players under contract in excess of those allowed to participate in regular season games, the latter has been called the "active roster." With exceptions through the years for varying economic conditions (primarily during World War I, the Great Depression, post-World War II and from 1986-1989 when the limit was made 24 because of rising player salaries), the active roster has allowed up to 25 players to participate for a Major League team within specified dates, currently Opening Day to September 1. In 1968 the 25-player maximum for active rosters was made a part of the first collective bargaining agreement between the major leagues and the Major League Baseball Players Association.

[0.581, 0.002]Original response: According to the Collective Bargaining Agreement between Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Player Association, the 25-man active roster was first implemented in 1968.
[0.617, 0.113]Prifix response: Since 1921, when teams were first allowed to have 25 players on their active rosters, September 1 has been the date when teams have been allowed to expand their rosters from 25 to 40 players. The 25-man roster has been used since 1921 as a way to limit the number of players on a team during the regular season, and to provide a way for teams to make changes to their rosters during the season. The 40-man roster was first used in 1921 and was intended to provide a way for the teams to have a larger roster during the regular season and to provide a way to make changes to the roster during the season. The teams have been able to expand their rosters to 40 players on September 1 since 1922, and the 25-man active roster has been used during the regular season.

Prompt: Overall No. Saga No. English translation Original Japanese title Original airdate American airdate 77 "Let's Do It, Zen-Oh Sama ! The All-Universe Martial Arts Tournament ! !" "Yarou ze Zenō-sama ! Uchū ichi Budō-kai ! !" (や ろう ぜ 全 王様 ! 宇宙 一 武道 会 ! !) February 5, 2017 TBA The Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō are playing a game together in their realm, but both have become bored with their monotonous routine. Meanwhile, Goku heads to a local farmer's market to sell his produce and get Chi-Chi off his back about making money. On the way home, he is ambushed by some robbers. Goku defeats them, but he is injured in the process. Deciding that he has grown rusty, Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis. They head to the Capsule Corporation building, where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta's second child. Goten remains behind to train with Trunks. Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth. Goku heads to Beerus ' planet alone. While training with Whis, Goku remembers Grand Zenō's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament. Heedless of Beerus and Whis ' warnings, Goku uses Grand Zenō's button to head to his realm and convinces Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament. When he returns to Beerus ' planet, Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Grand Zenō naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse. Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again. Goku, Beerus, and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais, where the Grand Minister arrives. He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the "Tournament of Power" (力 の 大会, Chikara no Taikai). 78 "The Gods of Every Universe in Shock ? ! Losers Erased in the Tournament of Power" "Zen uchū no kami-sama mo don hiki ! ? Maketara shōmetsu "Chikara no taikai"" (全 宇宙 の 神様 も ドン 引き ! ? 負け たら 消滅 「 力 の 大会 」) February 12, 2017 TBA The Grand Minister explains the details of the "Tournament of Power" and states that it will be held on "the World of Void". It is a place of "infinite nothingness", where the competitors can fight without limits. The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls, while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence. Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty. Goku suggests asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to ignore it, but Whis advises against this. Whis tells Goku that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous. Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament in the first place. Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces. The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zenō's benefit. Each universe is to name three fighters. Goku sets off to recruit teammates. After Vegeta refuses, Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu, who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7. Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan. Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic. Back at Grand Zenō's and Future Grand Zenō's palace, all the gods from all 12 universes gather. The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match. He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament. In the first round, Majin Buu is to fight Basil (バジル, Bajiru), a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9. 79 "Universe 9's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7's Majin Buu ! !" "Dai kyu uchū keri no Bajiru basasu Dai nana uchū Majinbū ! !" (第 9 宇宙 蹴り の バジル VS 第 7 宇宙 魔 人 ブウ ! !) February 19, 2017 TBA Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh (ロウ, Rō), the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender (ラベンダ, Rabenda) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match. Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender. 80 "Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit ! Son Gohan's Fight ! !" "Nemutta tōshi o yobisamase ! Son Gohan no tatakai ! !" (眠っ た 闘志 を 呼び覚ませ ! 孫 悟 飯 の 闘い ! !) February 26, 2017 TBA As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well. However, Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong. Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had long believed that there were too many universes. He was planning to erase most of them anyway, but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared. With the announcement concluded, the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo (ベルガモ, Berugamo), Basil's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine. 81 5 "Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku ! Which One Wields the Limitless Power ? !" "Tsubushi no Berugamo VS Son Gokū ! Aotenjō no tsuyosa wa dotchida ! ?" (潰し の ベルガモ VS 孫悟空 ! 青 天井 の 強 さ は どっち だ ! ?) March 5, 2017 TBA Before their battle begins, Bergamo denounces Goku before the assembled gods. Bergamo pleads with Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased. Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle. Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō will immediately erase all of the universes. Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms. When the fight begins, Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed. Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times, but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku's attacks. He grows stronger and physically larger. Goku continues to attack, which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight. Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue, which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha. Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure, but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge. The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin. The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner. Suddenly, a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo (トッポ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle. Goku, who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo, agrees to fight Toppo. 82 6 "Never Forgive Son Goku ! Toppo the Warrior of Justice Intrudes ! !" "Son Gokū yurusumaji ! Seigi no senshi Toppo ran'nyū ! ! !" (孫悟空 許す まじ ! 正義 の 戦士 トッポ 乱入 ! !) March 19, 2017 TBA After obtaining Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō blessing to proceed, Goku and Toppo begin their battle. Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku's shoulder. Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows, but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug. He begins squeezing the life out of Goku, which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape. Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha. Just as the two power up even more, the Grand Minister puts an end to the fight. As Toppo leaves, he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren (ジレン). The Grand Minister begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power. In the Sacred World of the Kais, Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku's constant relaxed and negligent attitude, which Whis breaks up. The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy. 83 7 "Form the Universe 7 Representing Team ! Who are the Strongest Ten ? !" "Dai-7 uchū daihyō chīmu o kessei seyo ! Saikyō no 10-ri wa dareda ?" (第 7 宇宙 代表 チーム を 結成 せよ ! 最強 の 10 人 は 誰 だ ! ?) March 26, 2017 TBA Goku and the others arrive at Capsule Corporation. They discuss who should be on the team. Goku immediately suggests Monaka, but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and can not participate. Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta, Piccolo, Krillin, Master Roshi, No. 18, and No. 17, which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine. Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience. They proceed to ask Vegeta, who has been thinking of a name for his second child. Vegeta refuses to participate. He says he will not fight, while Bulma is pregnant. Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight. Everyone celebrates the baby's birth. Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother. As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta, he develops an attachment to her. Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot. However, Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla's name. Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin's house. 84 8 "Son Goku the Recruiter Invites Krillin and No. 18" "Sukautoman Son Gokū--Kuririn to 18-gō o izanau" (スカウト マン 孫悟空 クリリン と 18 号 を 誘う) April 2, 2017 TBA Goku and Gohan arrive at Krillin's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power. No. 18 convinces Krillin to participate in order to put his newfound martial arts training to use. No. 18 is reluctant to join herself. She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them, but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward, which convinces her to participate. Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast. After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat, Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea. Goku is excited by Krillin's new power. He challenges him to a sparring match as well. They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan, where Krillin's strategies make up for the gap in power, forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form, and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash. As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin, No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku's Kamehameha, just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion. She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku can not expect to fight one-on-one all the time. Goku concedes the match and realizes he will have to adjust his tactics in order to win the Tournament of Power. No. 18 reveals that No. 17 is currently working at a wildlife reserve, but she does not know where. Goku decides to ask Dende to find No. 17. 85 9 "The Universes Begin to Make Their Moves Their Individual Motives" "Ugokidasu uchū--sorezore no omowaku" (動き出す 宇宙--それぞれ の 思惑) April 9, 2017 TBA Gohan leaves to recruit Piccolo, while Goku prepares to head to the Lookout. He encounters Majin Buu and Mr. Satan training. Goku discovers that Buu has lost weight and has gotten much slimmer in appearance. The two spar together. Buu defeats Goku by overwhelming him with ki blasts and knocking him out of the fighting stage. Meanwhile, Khai (カイ), the Supreme Kai of Universe 11, gathers all of the Supreme Kais involved in the tournament except for Universe 7's, who is ostracized due to Goku's involvement with the creation of the tournament. Khai asks his fellow Supreme Kais to request that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō cancel the erasure of the universes, but they are all too afraid of his wrath to do so. Champa gathers all the Gods of Destruction involved in the tournament except Beerus after finding out about the Supreme Kai's meeting, and they discuss Goku. Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers Kahseral (カーセラル, Kāseraru) and Dyspo (ディスポ, Disupo). Champa recruits Cabba and demands he find more powerful Saiyans. Goku meets Dende and Mr. Popo at the Lookout and learns No. 17's location. Gohan prepares to train with Piccolo. 86 10 "Fist Cross for the First Time ! Android # 17 VS Son Goku ! !" "Hajimete majiwaru kobushi ! Jinzōningen Jūnana-gō VS Son Gokū ! !" (初めて 交わる 拳 ! 人造 人間 17 号 VS 孫悟空 ! !) April 16, 2017 TBA On their way to the island where No. 17 is working, Dende explains that since the conclusion of the Cell Games, No. 17 has started a family and gotten far stronger. Dende also reveals that Kid Buu has reincarnated as a young Earthling with massive fighting potential and asks Goku to train him when he is old enough. They reach the island as Goku arrives just in time to witness No. 17 defeat a group of armed poachers. As they introduce themselves to each other, a large army of poachers arrive. Goku and No. 17 team up to subdue them all. Afterwards, No. 17 explains that the poachers are after the last Minotaurus in order to steal its rare and valuable horns. The two decide to have a sparring match. No. 17 evenly matches Super Saiyan Goku, which causes him to turn Super Saiyan Blue. Goku launches a Kamehameha at No. 17, who easily deflects it with an energy shield. The two go toe-to-toe until No. 17 ends the match in order to avoid catching the island in the crossfire. Goku and No. 17 acknowledge that they were both holding back in the fight. Afterwards, Goku attempts to convince him to join the Tournament of Power, but No. 17 is uninterested. He remains indifferent even when Goku reveals that the losing universes will be erased. Meanwhile, alien poachers arrive on Earth and they set their sights on the Minotaurus. 87 11 "Hunt the Poachers ! Goku and No. 17's United Front ! !" "Mitsuryō-dan o kare ! Gokū to Jūnana-gō no kyōtō ! !" (密漁 団 を 狩れ ! 悟空 と 17 号 の 共闘 ! !) April 23, 2017 TBA Goku entices No. 17 with a wish on the Super Dragon Balls. As he begins to consider Goku's offer, the alien poachers arrive and abduct all of the island's animals. Goku uses his Instant Transmission to teleport himself and No. 17 aboard their ship before it can escape. After defeating some of the poachers, No. 17 sets off to defeat the leader, while Goku remains behind to battle the rest of the poachers. No. 17 confronts and easily defeats the leader. Goku catches up just as the leader pulls out a switch and threatens to self-destruct if he is not released immediately. No. 17 smashes him out of a window, which vents both of them into deep space. Goku manages to use his Instant Transmission to teleport all three of them to King Kai's world. Dende contacts Goku and informs him that the leader's threat was a bluff. Afterwards, Goku and No. 17 return the animals to their rightful homes. Jaco arrives to arrest the alien poachers. No. 17 decides to leave his island in the hands of Goten and Trunks and accepts Goku's offer to fight in the Tournament of Power. He hopes to use the Super Dragon Balls to wish for an expensive boat and travel the world with his family. 88 12 "Gohan and Piccolo Teacher and Pupil Clash in Max Training !" "Gohan to Pikkoro Shitei gekitotsu no Genkai shugyō !" (悟 飯 と ピッコロ 師弟 激突 の 限界 修業 !) April 30, 2017 TBA Gohan and Piccolo engage in intense training. Piccolo explains that Goku has already informed him about the potential erasure of the universe and that he is going to participate in the Tournament of Power. He points out that Gohan's over eagerness to protect his loved ones is making him reckless. Gohan transforms into a Super Saiyan, and the two continue to spar. Meanwhile, Cabba heads to the residence of his retired captain and mentor, Renso (レンソウ). Cabba asks him to join Universe 6's team for the Tournament of Power, but Renso refuses due to an injury to his leg. Renso suggests his sister, Caulifla (カリフラ, Karifura), instead, who he claims is even stronger than him. Back in Universe 7, Piccolo removes his weighted clothes to go all out and quickly defeats Gohan. Piccolo explains that Gohan has a tendency to become arrogant when he has the advantage in battle. After being encouraged by Piccolo, Gohan manages to reach the level of power he had against Super Buu. The two fight again, and Gohan successfully severs Piccolo's arm. However, Piccolo blasts him in the back with the severed arm and defeats Gohan, which proves Piccolo's point about Gohan's overconfidence. That night, Piccolo vows to push Gohan to new heights of power. They both agree to work on combination moves. 89 13 "An Unknown Beauty Appears ! The Tenshin-Style Dojo's Mystery ? !" "Arawareta nazo no bijo ! Tenshin-ryū Dōjō no kai ! ?" (現れ た 謎 の 美女 ! 天津 流 道場 の 怪 ! ?) May 7, 2017 TBA Goku heads to Master Roshi's island, where Oolong informs him that Tien and Chiaotzu have started a martial arts dojo, and that Roshi has headed there to act as a special instructor. Goku decides to make Tien the tenth member of the team, and heads off to recruit him and Roshi. At Tien's dojo, a woman named Yurin (ユーリン, Yūrin) with a grudge against Tien arrives and requests to join the dojo. Although Tien denies her because her motivation of beauty was unfit for his dojo, Roshi drags Yurin off to ogle her. Goku arrives and asks Tien to join the Tournament of Power, but, even after Goku bribes him with 10 million Zeni, Tien refuses. Yurin escapes Roshi's advances and uses witchcraft to drive Tien's students on a rampage throughout town. Goku, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Roshi arrive at the village, where Yurin confronts them. Yurin explains that she is a former classmate of Tien's during his time at the Crane School and that she swore revenge on him after he left the school and refused to fight her. Meanwhile, Cabba sways Caulifla into joining Universe 6's team by promising to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. Back on Earth, while Goku, Chiaotzu, and Tien cure the students of their brainwashing, Roshi battles Yurin. He lowers his guard after catching a glimpse of Yurin's panties, which allows her to brainwash him. The brainwashed Roshi quickly defeats Tien, but Goku intervenes. While Chiaotzu temporarily disables Yurin, Goku subdues Roshi with a Kamehameha and cures him of the brainwashing. Tien orders Yurin to apologize to everyone she hurt and offers her a place at his dojo. Tien decides to join the Tournament of Power because he believes that the 10 million Zeni Goku promised will repair the village. After hearing about the 10 million Zeni, Master Roshi quickly agrees to join as well. 90 14 "See The Wall That Must Be Passed ! Goku vs Gohan" "Koerubeki kabe o misuete ! Gokū bāsasu Gohan" (超える べき 壁 を 見据え て ! 悟空 VS 悟 飯) May 14, 2017 TBA As Gohan finishes training with Piccolo, they go to meet with Goku, Master Roshi, and Tien. At Gohan's request, Goku and Tien have a fight against Gohan and Piccolo to practice for the tournament. Although Tien views this as a practice match and wants to avoid injuring anyone, Gohan and Goku take the fight seriously. As Gohan fights both his father and Tien, Piccolo spends the time charging a strong technique, which ultimately destroys the mountain fighting stage when it is launched. Tien calls the match off on the grounds that the fighting stage is now destroyed. Although Goku agrees, Gohan requests to have a one-on-one fight against his father. Goku accepts, and Gohan powers up while Goku goes Super Saiyan 2. Although Goku has the upper hand for much of the fight, Gohan turns the tables and begins to overpower Goku. Gohan begs Goku to use his full power. Goku responds by becoming a Super Saiyan Blue and using his Kaio-Ken technique, then defeats Gohan with a single blow. Impressed with his son's improvement, Goku assigns Gohan as the leader of their Universe 7 team. Meanwhile, Rumsshi (ラムーシ, Ramūshi) recruits a powerful fighter named Murichim (ムリチム, Murichimu) and his companions to represent Universe 10 in the tournament. 91 15 "Which Universe Will Survive ? ! The Strongest Warriors Are Gathering ! !" "Kachinokoru no wa dono Uchū da ! ? Zokuzoku to tsudou Saikyō no senshi-tachi ! !" (勝ち残る の は どの 宇宙 だ ! ? 続々 と 集う 最強 の 戦士 たち ! !) May 21, 2017 TBA Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō are suffering from extreme boredom again. They decide to observe the universes ' progress in assembling their strongest warriors. In Universe 7, Vegeta prepares to enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber for some intense training. Goku spars with Whis in Vegeta's gravity chamber. Master Roshi and Puar train to remove Roshi's weakness to seduction techniques, which fails miserably. In Universe 9, word has spread of the potential erasure of their universe. The populace has descended into anarchy. The three canine brothers have been unable to find any other fighters. In Universe 6, Hit tracks down the destitute Frost and forces him to join the Tournament of Power, while he relieves him of his poison needles in the process. In Universe 11, Toppo's comrade Kahseral is delayed from joining when he aids a cat stuck in a tree. In Universe 2, a magical girl named Brianne de Chateau (ブリアン ・ デ ・ シャトー, Burian de Shatō) transforms into her alter ego named Ribrianne (リブリアン, Riburian) and auditions for a spot in the tournament. In Universe 10, Murichim and his comrades record a dance video to improve team spirit. Back in Universe 7, Mr. Satan calls and unexpectedly reveals that Majin Buu has fallen into a deep sleep and can not join the tournament, which horrifies everyone. 92 16 "Emergency Development ! The Incomplete Ten Members ! !" "Kinkyū jitai hassei ! Sorowanai jū nin no menbā ! !" (緊急 事態 発生 ! そろわ ない 10 人 の メンバー ! !) May 28, 2017 TBA Goku races to Mr. Satan's house, where he proves unable to wake Majin Buu from his hibernation. Meanwhile, all of Universe 7's remaining warriors except Master Roshi and No. 17 gather at the Capsule Corporation. After Krillin brings up the 10 million Zeni prize that Goku had bribed him, Piccolo and Gohan reveal to Krillin, No. 18, and Tien that the prize of 10 million Zeni was a lie and that the universe will be erased if they lose. When Goku returns, Krillin berates him and threatens to withdraw from the team along with No. 18. After Goku fails to convince them otherwise, Beerus swiftly threatens Krillin into staying, while Bulma agrees to pay out the promised reward. In Universe 6, Cabba takes Caulifla to a deserted wasteland to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. As Caulifla's protégée, Kale (ケール, Kēru), observes them, Cabba ineffectually attempts to provoke Caulifla in order to make her transform. When that fails, he teaches her to focus her energy on an area in her back. Caulifla successfully transforms into a Super Saiyan. Caulifla tests her newfound power and agrees to join Universe 6's team for the Tournament of Power. She beckons Kale over to attempt the transformation herself. In Universe 11, Kahseral arrives at the Pride Trooper headquarters, where he and Toppo agree to leave the universe in their trainees ' hands so they can participate in the tournament. In Universe 3, two cyborg warriors named Nigrisshi (ニグリシ, Nigrisshi) and Narirama (ナリラマ, Narirāma) display their upgrades for the tournament to Universe 3's God of Destruction Mosco (モスコ, Mosuko), Supreme Kai Ea (エア), and Angel Campari (カンパーリ, Kanpāri). Back in Universe 7, Goku and his friends are unable to figure out who can replace Buu. When Beerus claims they have no suitable fighters because Goku destroyed the Frieza Force, Goku is inspired to recruit Frieza, which shocks everyone. 93 17 "You're The Tenth Warrior ! Goku Goes To See Frieza ! !" "Jū ninme no senshi wa omē da ! Gokū Furīza no moto e ! !" (10 人目 の 戦士 はお め え だ ! 悟空 フリーザ の も と へ ! !) June 4, 2017 TBA Goku's idea is met with much hesitance from his comrades. He explains that he intends to have Fortuneteller Baba resurrect Frieza for 24 hours to fight in the tournament. If Frieza betrays them then either he or Vegeta can defeat him. Goku's friends reluctantly agree, and he sets out to the afterlife. The Universe 7 team are unaware that a spy from Universe 4 is observing them. In Universe 6, Cabba and Caulifla attempt to teach Kale how to turn into a Super Saiyan but to no avail. Kale begins to despair over her own uselessness, and it enrages her enough to trigger her transformation into an extremely powerful Berserker Super Saiyan. Kale immediately goes berserk and attacks Cabba. Caulifla quickly deduces that Kale is jealous of her and Cabba's perceived relationship. She denies having any sort of feelings for Cabba. Kale calms down and collapses in Caulifla's arms. Cabba, who is impressed by Kale's power, decides to add her to Universe 6's team. Back in Universe 7, Goku arrives in the afterlife and receives King Yemma's permission to visit Frieza. He explains about the Tournament of Power and asks Frieza to join them. Frieza agrees to aid him on the condition that he be properly resurrected with Earth's Dragon Balls. When Goku hesitates to agree, Frieza goads him by playing to his desire to see how powerful Frieza can become. Goku accepts his terms. In Universe 4, Ganos (ガノス, Ganosu) reports Universe 7's latest actions to Universe 4's God of Destruction Quitela (キテラ, Kitera) and Supreme Kai Kuru (クル). Quitela immediately begins making plans to counter Beerus. 94 18 "The Emperor of Evil Returns ! A Reception of Mysterious Assassins ? !" "Aku no Teiō fukkatsu ! Demukaeru Nazo no Shikaku-tachi ! ?" (悪 の 帝王 復活 ! 出迎える 謎 の 刺客 たち ! ?) June 11, 2017 TBA Quitela contacts Universe 9's God of Destruction Sidra (シドラ, Shidora) and informs him that Universe 7 is planning to use Frieza to assassinate their rivals before the tournament begins and that the only way to counter them is to kill them first. Sidra and Roh agree to have Frieza killed. Meanwhile, Goku returns to the Capsule Corporation to update everyone on his success. As Master Roshi completes his training at Korin's tower, Krillin and No. 18 head to No. 17's island to pick him up and drop off Goten, Trunks, and Marron. Goku goes to Fortuneteller Baba's home, where she completes the ritual to resurrect Frieza. As Goku and Frieza prepare to depart, an army of assassins arrives to claim their heads. Despite the time pressure, Frieza wounds the assassins ' leader, transforms into his Golden form, and prepares for battle. 95 19 "The Worst ! The Most Evil ! Frieza's Rampage ! !" "Saikyō ! Saiaku ! Furīza Ōabare ! !" (最 凶 ! 最悪 ! フリーザ 大 暴れ ! !) June 18, 2017 TBA Frieza explains to Goku that he spent his recent incarceration in Hell undergoing intense mental training to overcome the stamina issues that plagued him during his previous battles with the Z-Fighters. He quickly slaughters most of the assassins, which horrifies Goku. The assassins ' leader, who has been directly empowered by Sidra, attacks Frieza with Sidra's power, but Frieza manages to overcome and hijack the attack. Frieza spitefully uses the attack on Goku and traps him. Frieza tortures and kills the assassins until they reveal that Roh and Sidra hired them. Frieza contacts Universe 9 and offers his services as a defector. Roh and Sidra begin arguing about whether or not to accept him. Roh fears Frieza's psychopathic and treasonous nature, while Sidra wants his power. Sidra is confident he could kill him if he stepped out of line. Their argument buys time for Beerus and Whis to arrive and rescue Goku. Frieza cuts the connection. He begins making plans to use the Tournament of Power to manipulate the gods to suit his own ends. Goku and Frieza have a brief sparring match, which ends in a draw. Goku, Frieza, Beerus, and Whis return to the Capsule Corporation. The Universe 7 team prepare to travel to the World of Void for the Tournament of Power. 96 20 "The Time Is Here ! To The World Of Void For The Fate Of The Universe ! !" "Toki wa kita ! Uchū no Meiun o kake Mu no Kai e ! !" (時 は きた ! 宇宙 の 命運 を かけ 無 の 界 へ ! !) June 25, 2017 TBA In the World of Void, Universes 1, 5, and 8's Gods of Destruction Iwne (イワン, Iwan), Arack (アラク, Araku), and Liquiir (リキュール, Rikīru) have a brief exhibition match to test the durability of the Tournament of Power's fighting stage. Afterwards, the Grand Minister forces them all to clean up their mess and fix the stage. In Universe 7, Gohan and Shin's strategy is to have the team members stick together to conserve energy and use strength of numbers to defeat anyone who attacks them. This suggestion offends Goku and Vegeta's Saiyan pride. Whis transports the team to the World of Void. All of the other universes arrive. Frieza and Frost befriend each other and agree to work together, while Goku singles out Jiren as a potential rival due to his extreme power. As the Grand Minister introduces each team, Universe 4 seemingly has only 8 warriors on their team, which confuses most of Universe 7, except for Tien, who tells No. 18 that he can sense a faint presence. After a speech from the Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō, the 80 warriors prepare for battle. 97 21 "Survive ! The Tournament of Power Begins at Last ! !" "Ikinokore ! Tsui ni kaimaku Chikara no Taikai ! !" (生き残れ ! ついに 開幕 「 力 の 大会 」 ! !) July 2, 2017 TBA The Grand Minister reminds everyone of the rules and officially starts the tournament. A massive free-for-all ensues. Goku targets Toppo, but he is intercepted by Ganos. Disregarding Gohan's plan as well, No. 17, No. 18, Vegeta, and Frieza all jump into the fray. Universe 3 gains an early advantage when Narirama unleashes a spinning attack designed to knock its opponents off the stage, but Hit and Basil disable it. Universe 10's Lilibeu (リリベウ, Ririberu) attacks Basil, but Basil successfully knocks her off the stage. Meanwhile, the five Universe 7 warriors who stayed together are confronted by a gang of warriors from varying universes, but Universe 7 uses teamwork to fend them off. Basil nearly defeats Universe 10's Napapa, but Napapa is able to push his attacks away at the last moment. As Goku is pursuing Toppo, he comes face to face with Jiren until Universe 4's Nink (ニンク, Ninku) outflanks Goku by grappling and dragging him towards the edge of the stage with the intention of jumping off with him. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and knocks Nink off the stage. As Goku reverts back to his normal form to conserve energy, Basil, Lavender, Bergamo, and two other Universe 9 warriors surround him with 47 minutes remaining in the tournament. 98 22 "Oh, Uncertainty ! A Universe Despairs ! !" "Ā mujou ! Zetsubō suru Uchū ! !" (あぁ 無常 ! 絶望 する 宇宙 ! !) July 9, 2017 TBA Roh orders his warriors to attack Goku to avenge their defeat at the Zen Exhibition Match. Goku is forced to avoid fighting at his fullest in order to conserve stamina for later in the tournament. He fights Team Universe 9, where the Trio de Dangers brothers manage to overwhelm him thanks to their teamwork. Vegeta notices Goku's plight and reinforces him. Roh sends over three more fighters. Team Universe 9 is able to push Goku and Vegeta to the brink until Vegeta tricks Lavender and Hop (ソレル, Hoppu) into accidentally hitting each other. Goku and Vegeta take advantage of the confusion to defeat five of the Universe 9 warriors. No. 18 and Frieza each defeat Sorrel (ソレル, Soreru) and Roselle. Only Basil, Lavender, and Bergamo remain in the tournament for Team Universe 9. Goku and Vegeta push them to the edge of the stage. The brothers use a combination beam as a last ditch effort, but Goku and Vegeta power up to Super Saiyan Blue and knock them off the stage with a Final Kamehameha. With all 10 members defeated, Universe 9 is eliminated from the tournament. As a result, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erase Universe 9, Roh, Sidra, and all of their fighters. This amuses Universe 9's angel Mojito (モヒイト, Mohi'ito) and horrifies everyone else. 99 23 "Show Them ! Krillin's True Power ! !" "Misetsukero ! Kuririn no sokojikara ! !" (見せつけろ ! クリリン の 底力 ! !) July 16, 2017 TBA As the other warriors recover from the shock of Universe 9's erasure, No. 17 reminds No. 18 that they have infinite stamina due to their cyborg bodies and have no reason to hold back. Vegeta tries to fight Hit, but he is blocked by Botamo, who is immune to damage. Vegeta manages to pick Botamo up and nearly throws him off the stage, but Magetta stops him at the last moment. Meanwhile, Universe 10's Jium (ジウム, Jiumu) attacks Gohan and his friends. Jium is swiftly defeated by Master Roshi. Universe 4's Shosa (ショイサ, Shōsa) tricks No. 18 into lowering her guard by faking his own death and nearly knocks her off the stage with a barrage of ki blasts. Krillin rescues No. 18, and the two defeat Shosa with a powerful combination attack. They are challenged by Universe 4's Majora (マジョラ), who is a blind fighter that uses his powerful sense of smell to locate his enemies in battle. Although Majora proves to be stronger than Krillin, Krillin disables his nose by throwing his smelly shoe at him and knocks him off the stage. Krillin boasts about his victory, which allows Frost to knock him off with a single blow. Beerus and Shin berate Krillin for his carelessness with 43 minutes remaining in the tournament. 100 24 "Out Of Control ! The Savage Berserker Awakens ! !" "Daibōsō ! Mezame araburu Kyōsenshi ! !" (大 暴走 ! 目覚め 荒 ぶる 狂 戦士 ! !) July 23, 2017 TBA As Universe 7 recovers from Krillin's defeat, Cabba defeats Nigrisshi and Universe 10's Murisam (ムリサーム) and confronts Vegeta. Hit blows off Narirama's limbs and uses his time skip ability to dodge his ultimate attack. He flicks him off the stage. Meanwhile, Kale is disabled by Universe 10's Napapa and Methiop (メチオープ). They knock her unconscious and attempt to throw her off the stage, but Caulifla rescues her and defeats Napapa. The two confront Goku, and Caulifla knocks away Universe 2's Jimeze (ジーミズ, Jimizu) and demands to know how to become a Super Saiyan Blue. Goku refuses, and Caulifla transforms into an Ultra Super Saiyan. However, her increased muscle mass cripples her speed and allows Goku to counterattack. With Goku's aid, Caulifla manages to become a Super Saiyan 2, and the two resume their fight. As Kale watches them, she is once again consumed by her feelings of uselessness and transforms into her Berserker Super Saiyan form. Hit uses his time skip to save Caulifla from getting caught in the crossfire. Kale flies into a jealous rage and attacks Goku for allegedly stealing Caulifla from her. Kale easily overwhelms Goku and forces him to power up to Super Saiyan Blue. He unleashes a powerful Kamehameha, but Kale powers through it unharmed. As Piccolo realizes she has lost control of her power, Kale begins firing ki blasts at everything in sight and defeats Methiop. When Universe 11's Vuon (ブーオン, Būon) attempts to stop her, Kale defeats him as well. Jiren knocks her unconscious with a single ki blast. As Hit and Caulifla retreat with Kale, Goku challenges Jiren. 101 25 "The Impending Warriors of Justice ! The Pride Troopers ! !" "Semari kuru seigi no senshi ! Puraido Torūpāsu ! !" (迫り くる 正義 の 戦士 ! プライド ・ トルーパス ! !) July 30, 2017 TBA As Goku prepares to fight Jiren, Toppo suddenly ambushes him with a barrage of ki blasts. Toppo and Jiren decide to retreat and conserve their stamina. This leaves Goku to be dealt with by Kahseral and their fellow Pride Troopers Tupper (タッパー, Tappā), Zoiray (ゾイレー, Zoirē), Cocotte (ココット, Kokotto), and Kettol. The five declare their intent to defeat Caulifla and Kale to avenge Vuon's defeat. The two are forced to form a temporary alliance with Goku. Meanwhile, Master Roshi and Tien team up to defeat Universe 3's The Preecho (ザ ・ プリーチョ). They regroup with Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Frieza, where he has defeated Murichim. The Pride Troopers push Goku, Caulifla, and Kale to the brink, but No. 17 and No. 18 rescue them. No. 18 and Goku defeat Tupper, while No. 17 easily overpowers Kahseral. The remaining Pride Troopers regroup and focus their assault on the wounded Caulifla and Kale. Cocotte seals them in a separate dimension to ensure that Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 do not interfere. As the four beat Caulifla, Kale's self-hatred causes her to return to the Berserker Super Saiyan form, but she remains in control of herself this time. Caulifla and Kale use an extremely powerful combination ki blast to defeat Kahseral, Zoiray, and Kettol. Cocotte seals herself in a mini-dimension to avoid the blast, but No. 18 simply throws it off, eliminating Cocotte. Goku allows Caulifla and Kale to retreat so he can fight them at their full strength after they rest. The group is unaware that Brianne is observing them. 102 26 "The Power of Love Explodes ? ! Universe 2's Little Witch Warriors ! !" "Ai no chikara ga dai bakuhatsu ! ? dai ni uchu majo-kko senshi ! !" (愛 の 力 が 大 爆発 ! ? 第 2 宇宙 の 魔女 っ 子 戦士 ! !) August 6, 2017 TBA Brianne and her companions Sanka Ku (サンカ ・ クー, Sanka Kū) and Su Roas (スー ・ ロース, Sū Rōsu) announce themselves to the other fighters and begin to transform into their magical girl alter-egos. No. 17 blasts them before they can transform, but Brianne, Goku, and Toppo berate him for his dishonorable tactics and browbeat him into allowing them to transform, much to Beerus ' dismay. They assume their alter-egos Ribrianne, Kakunsa (カクンサ, Kakunsa), and Rozie (ロージィ, Rōjī) and barrage the arena with a powerful love-based attack that brainwashes some of the fighters. Universe 7's mental discipline allows them to overcome its effects. Gohan's group elects to split up and fight independently. Vegeta attacks Ribrianne, who counters with a rolling attack that knocks out Universe 10's Jirasen (ジラセン). Rozie attacks Goku with a flurry of blows that grows more powerful the longer she keeps it up, while Kakunsa battles No. 17 with her animalistic fighting style. No. 17 baits her into overextending herself and stuns her with a barrier. He attempts to knock her out of the stage, but her teammate Vikal (ビカル, Bikaru) rescues her. No. 17 decides to stop holding back and swiftly eliminates Vikal. He also eliminates Kakunsa with a powerful ki blast. Enraged by his actions, Ribrianne powers up and prepares to battle No. 17. 103 27 "Gohan, Show No Mercy ! Showdown With Universe 10 ! !" "Gohan yo hijōnare ! Dai ju uchu to no kessen ! !" (悟 飯 よ 非情 なれ ! 第 10 宇宙 と の 決戦 ! !) August 13, 2017 TBA Ribrianne and No. 17 fiercely attack each other, while Rozie begins to overwhelm Goku's defenses. She surrounds him with ki balls and attempts to blow him up, but No. 17 protects him with a barrier. Goku, who has studied Rozie's techniques, hits her with a powerful ki blast. As he and No. 17 corner Rozie and Ribrianne, Jimeze arrives and rescues them with instant transmission. Elsewhere, Botamo challenges Gohan on Champa's orders. As Piccolo and Goku observe, Gohan attacks with a flurry of blows, which apparently have no effect. However, Gohan's attacks begin to lift Botamo off the ground and renders him unable to defend himself, allowing Gohan to knock him off the stage. Universe 10's Obuni (オブニ) and Rubalt (ルバルト, Rubaruto) appear to challenge Gohan and Piccolo. Jimeze defeats Universe 10's Jilcol (ジルコル Jirukoru). With 8 warriors eliminated, Gowasu accepts his imminent demise, while Rumsshi remains defiant. Obuni shifts his ki away from his body to render himself impossible to detect and wounds Gohan. Rubalt initially has the upper hand against Piccolo, but Piccolo uses his Hellzone Grenade attack to knock out Rubalt, leaving Universe 10 with only Obuni. Obuni begins to overwhelm Gohan, which makes Gowasu want to cling to life again. Gohan powers up and powers through one of Obuni's punches. He counterattacks Obuni's moves by locating and hitting Obuni after he gets hit. Obuni pauses the fight to show his respect for Gohan, but refuses to lose for the sake of Universe 10. Gohan battles and defeats Obuni with a Kamehameha. All of Universe 10's fighters have been eliminated. Right before Universe 10 is annihilated, Gohan discovers a locket containing a picture of Obuni and his wife and child. Gohan and Universe 10's angel, Cus (クス, Kusu), mourn Universe 10's erasure. 104 28 "The Ultimate High Speed Battle Begins ! Goku and Hit Join Forces ! !" "Chōzetsu kōsoku batoru boppatsu ! Gokū to hitto no kyōdō sensen ! !" (超絶 光速 バトル 勃発 ! 悟空 と ヒット の 共同 戦線 ! !) August 20, 2017 TBA Dyspo challenges Hit and uses his incredible speed to overwhelm Hit's Time Skip. Everyone quickly deduces that Dyspo is listening for the sound of Hit's body tensing up to determine when he is about to attempt to use Time Skip. Hit resorts to fighting him conventionally, but he is pushed to the edge of the stage. Toppo deduces that Hit has adjusted to Dyspo's fighting style and is luring him into a trap. Toppo sends fellow pride trooper Kunshi (クンシー, Kunshī) to back him up. Before Dyspo can land the finishing blow, Hit suddenly turns intangible and sends Dyspo over the edge. However, Kunshi uses ropes made of his energy to pull Dyspo back onto the stage before he is eliminated. The two launch a renewed assault against Hit and drive him into a corner. Before they can finish him off, Goku interferes and rescues Hit. Goku uses his Super Saiyan God form to counter Dyspo's speed, while Hit uses his assassination technique to injure Kunshi. The two switch places. Hit uses a fake Time Skip to throw Dyspo off and wound him, while Goku overwhelms Kunshi with his Super Saiyan Blue form. Hit attempts to eliminate Dyspo, but Kunshi rescues him again. Kunshi charges Hit, who turns intangible and knocks him off the stage. Dyspo retreats and regroups with his allies. Toppo abandons all notions of justice and decides to focus on survival. Hit decides not to battle Goku as thanks for lending a hand. Goku and Hit vow to settle their score if they both make it to the end of the tournament. 105 29 "A Desperate Battle ! Master Roshi's Sacrifice ! !" "Funsen ! Mutenroshi inochi o Moyasu ! !" (奮戦 ! 武 天 老師 命 を 燃やす ! !) August 27, 2017 TBA Master Roshi quietly observes the battles from afar. He is challenged by an attractive warrior from Universe 4, Caway (キャウェイ, Kyauei), who attempts to seduce him. However, Caway's attempts to attack him brings him back to his senses. Roshi destroys her energy weapon, powers up, and drives her to jump off the stage. Roshi is next challenged by Dercori (ダーコリ, Dākori), who is a talisman-wielding warrior from Universe 4. She uses her talismans to confound Roshi with illusions and trap him in a single spot. Roshi uses the Evil Containment Wave to seal her in a small bottle and throw her off the arena. Quitela and Beerus get into an argument about the legality of the move, which is defused when Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō rule in Roshi's favor. Ganos, who is enraged at Roshi for eliminating his friends, challenges him and powers up into an avian form. Initially, Roshi is able to use his experience to predict, evade, and counter Ganos ' attacks. However, Ganos is able to grow more powerful the longer a fight drags on. He rallies and delivers a fierce series of blows to Roshi. Roshi attempts to hypnotize Ganos into falling asleep, but he attacks himself to wake himself up. Ganos demands that Roshi accept his limits and give up, but Roshi refuses. He unleashes a Max Power Kamehameha that defeats Ganos. However, the effort is too much for Roshi's body to handle, and he collapses. Goku races over to him and successfully defibrillates him with his ki. Goku escorts Roshi to safety. 106 30 "Find Him ! Death Match With An Invisible Attacker ! !" "Mikiwamero ! Sugata naki atakkā to no shitō ! !" (見極めろ ! 姿 なき アタッカー と の 死闘 ! !) September 3, 2017 TBA Goku brings Master Roshi to an isolated part of the stage and leaves him to rest at his request. Gohan and Piccolo are confronted by Universe 6's Dr. Rota (Dr. ロタ, Dokutā Rota), but Rota is shot down by a sniper before he can reveal his ability. Gohan and Piccolo are unable to find the location of the sniper until they find a red orb on the ground. It is revealed that the sniper, Universe 2's Prum (プラン, Puran), can see through these orbs. The lasers ricochet off of the orbs so that his true location is a secret. Piccolo tries to create a smokescreen in order to blur the vision, but Prum can still see them via their heat signatures. Prum shoots Piccolo and destroys both of his arms, which forces him to painfully regenerate them. Gohan and Piccolo realize that the orbs depend on heat signatures and blast the surrounding area to create multiple heat signatures. Prum responds by coming out of his hiding spot and blasting the entire area. Gohan and Piccolo are forced into hiding. Tien analyzes Dr. Rota and deduces that he was hit by a sniper as Goku and Vegeta arrive. Vegeta berates Tien, who warns them about Prum, but Vegeta arrogantly brushes it off until he is almost incapacitated by one of Prum's blasts. As Goku and Tien observe Prum, they deduce that there is another shooter from behind as Prum is merely reflecting the blasts. Vegeta and Goku go after Prum, while Tien goes to save Gohan and Piccolo. Goku and Vegeta try to attack Prum, but their ki blasts are reflected off of his body. Tien navigates through the field of blasts and confronts the true sniper, Prum's teammate Hermila (ハーミラ, Hāmira). Realizing that Prum can deflect ki blasts and not physical attacks, Vegeta and Goku throw giant boulders at him. Tien uses his Multi-form technique in order to buy himself time against Hermila, but three of his clones are shot down. The fourth and final Tien defeats Hermila. Just as Tien is about to eliminate him, Hermila shoots the ground underneath Tien's feet and knocks him off the stage. However, Tien's other three clones come back and drag Hermila down with them. Tien and Hermila are eliminated from the tournament. Although Beerus praises Tien for forcing the battle into a draw, Tien is noticeably upset about being defeated. As Prum is confronted by Vegeta, Dr. Rota comes back and attacks Prum as revenge for shooting him. Shortly after, Vegeta eliminates Prum and Dr. Rota from the tournament. 107 31 "Revenge "F" The Cunning Trap ? !" "Fukushū no Efu ! Shikakerareta Kōkatsu na Wana ! ?" (復讐 の 「 F 」 ! しかけ られ た 狡猾 な 罠 ! ?) September 17, 2017 TBA Frost recalls how Champa promised to pardon his crimes if he humiliated and defeated Universe 7. Elsewhere, Universe 3's Maji Kayo confronts Universe 11's remaining warriors. He entraps Dyspo with his liquid body, but Jiren effortlessly defeats him with a single blow. As Master Roshi attempts to recover from his previous fights, Frost corners and attacks him. Goku sees this and tries to rush to his aid, but he is confronted by Ribrianne. Roshi hits Frost with a flurry of blows and attempts to use the Evil Containment Wave, but the strain proves too much for him. He flubs the attack. Frost barrages Roshi with ki blasts and sends an attack towards Vegeta, which provokes him. Vegeta interferes before Frost can finish Roshi. Magetta arrives to reinforce Frost, and the two battle Vegeta. Frost goads Roshi into using the Evil Containment Wave on Magetta despite the risk of killing himself. When Roshi falls for it, Frost reflects the attack and seals Vegeta into a bottle. With the last of his strength, Roshi uses a small ki blast to destroy the bottle and free Vegeta. Vegeta immediately turns Super Saiyan Blue, and Frost flees. Vegeta knocks Magetta off the stage and tells Roshi to drop out so he can receive medical attention. Roshi jumps off the stage, and he is given a Senzu Bean. Beerus admits that Roshi has earned his respect. 108 32 "Frieza and Frost ! Conjoined Malice ? !" "Furīza to Furosuto ! Majiwaru Akui ! ?" (フリーザ と フロスト ! 交わる 悪意 ! ?) September 24, 2017 TBA As Goku battles Ribrianne, the gods of the top four universes speculate on who will win the tournament. Meanwhile, Gohan is confronted by Jimeze. Jimeze makes use of his Instant Transmission technique to confound and damage Gohan. As he prepares to finish him, Frieza intervenes. When Frieza does not immediately attack Jimeze, Universe 7's spectators speculate he may intend to betray and defeat Gohan so he can seize the wish on the Super Dragon Balls for himself. Frieza steps aside and allows Jimeze to continue his fight with Gohan. Jimeze corners Gohan again and attempts to finish him, but Frieza destroys his attack with a ki blast. Enraged, Jimeze attacks Frieza, who swiftly tortures and eliminates him. Frost appears and declares his intention to defeat Gohan, and Frieza admits that the two intend to work together in order to exact revenge on the Saiyans. Frieza battles Gohan, who counterattacks. Frieza uses his Golden form to knock out Gohan. However, instead of eliminating him, he double-crosses and eliminates Frost. Gohan admits that he immediately figured out Frieza's plan and played along with him. An enraged Frost attempts to attack Frieza from the spectator stands, but Grand Zenō erases him, explaining that this is forbidden and Universe 6 would be erased upon a second offence. Meanwhile, Goku continues to battle Ribrianne. 109 33 "The Ultimate Enemy Approaches Goku ! Now, Let Loose ! The Killer Spirit Bomb ! !" "Goku ni Semaru Saikyo no Teki ! Ima Koso Hanate ! Hisassu no Genki-Dama ! !" (悟空 に 迫る 最強 の 敵 ! 今 こそ 放 て ! 必殺 の 元気 玉 ! !) October 8, 2017 TBA Ribrianne declares her intention to use the wish to become a love goddess adored by all beings using the Super Dragon Balls. Goku considers using the wish to benefit his family or meet a strong opponent. Ribrianne absorbs the love of her teammates and becomes Super Ribrianne. She attacks Goku with several ki blasts, and he counters by turning Super Saiyan Blue and knocking her away. Ribrianne lands near Jiren, and Goku sees him and prepares to finally battle him. Universe 11's God of Destruction, Belmod, telepathically orders Jiren to defeat Goku. Belmod hopes to demoralize the other universes by defeating the strongest fighter besides Jiren himself. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20, but that proves to be no match for Jiren's overwhelming power. Goku begins powering up a Spirit Bomb, and all of his teammates except Vegeta lend him their energy. Despite the time it takes to charge the attack, Jiren agrees to wait for him to complete it. Ribrianne attempts to attack Goku from behind, but she is stopped by Vegeta. Goku completes the Spirit Bomb and throws it, but Jiren deflects it. The two engage in a struggle to take control of the Spirit Bomb. This forces Goku to use Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 to keep up. However, Jiren prevails and begins to overwhelm Goku with his own attack. 110 34 "Son Goku Wakes ! New Level of the Awakened ! !" "Son Gokū kakusei ! Mezameshi mono no aratanaru gokui ! !" (孫悟空 覚醒 ! 目覚め し 者 の 新た なる 極意 ! !) October 8, 2017 TBA Goku powers up himself and pushes the Spirit Bomb back towards Jiren, which locks him in a stalemate. Whis realizes that Jiren is at least as powerful as a God of Destruction. As the two struggle to overpower each other, the Spirit Bomb suddenly condenses into a small black hole, which absorbs Goku and causes him to vanish. The Grand Minister rules that since Goku's own attack apparently vaporized him, Jiren will not be disqualified for destroying him. As Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō prepare to eliminate Goku, he suddenly reappears and reaches a new level of power. Goku resumes the fight, and he is able to go toe-to-toe with Jiren. Whis theorizes Goku must have absorbed the Spirit Bomb and unlocked an ability called Ultra Instinct (身勝手 の 極意" 兆", Migatte no Gokui). Goku uses another powerful attack in an attempt to eliminate Jiren, but he fails, and exhausts his newfound power. Jiren knocks him away, and Hit attempts to take advantage of the opportunity and attacks Jiren. Vegeta demands to know what happened to Goku before preparing to fight Ribrianne, while Frieza appears to corner Goku and aims an attack at him. 111 35 "The Surreal Supreme Battle ! Hit vs Jiren ! !" "I jigen no kyokuchi batoru ! Hitto basasu Jiren ! !" (異 次元 の 極致 バトル ! ヒット VS ジレン ! !) October 15, 2017 TBA Instead of killing the defenseless Goku, Frieza shares with him some of his energy and repays his act of mercy during their fight on Planet Namek. Meanwhile, Hit uses his time-skip powers against Jiren, but his attacks fail to connect. Goku spectates the battle, but he is ambushed by Saonel (サオネル, Saoneru) and Pirina (ピリナ, Pirina), Namekians from Universe 6, who are confronted by Gohan and Piccolo. Elsewhere, Vegeta fights Ribrianne, and he is easily overpowering her in his base form until Rozie interferes and retreats with Ribrianne. Ribrianne loses hope due to the gap in power, but Rozie motivates her. Meanwhile, Hit keeps attacking Jiren to no avail, but he is able to react and block most of Jiren's punches. After being knocked back, Hit sneaks up behind Jiren and lands a strong punch on his heart. He knocks Jiren to the edge of the ring after a brief struggle. Hit uses his own time-skip powers continually on Jiren to stop his movement. Realizing that he can not hold Jiren for long, Hit urges Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale to keep fighting for Universe 6. Hit pools all his energy in a final attack to defeat him, but Jiren stops Hit's attack only with his glare. Jiren breaks free and eliminates Hit. As the Tournament of Power reaches its midway point, Jiren begins to meditate. He is certain that there are no other warriors strong enough to fight him. Jiren leaves the fight to Toppo and Dyspo. Viara (ビアラ, Biara) and Katopesla (カトペスラ, Katopesura) of Universe 3 attempt to attack him while meditating, but Jiren's energy alone is enough to push them back. 112 36 "A Saiyan's Vow ! Vegeta's Resolution ! !" "Saiya-jin no chikai ! Bejīta no kakugo ! !" (サイヤ 人 の 誓い ! ベジータ の 覚悟 ! !) October 22, 2017 TBA Despite his exhaustion and low energy, Goku is determined to keep fighting. However, he is suddenly targeted by Koitsukai (コイツカイ, Koitukai), Panchia (パンチア, Panchia), and Bollarator (ボラレータ, Borarēta) of Universe 3. Gohan and Piccolo want to help him, but they are distracted by their own battle with Saonel and Pilina. Caulifla and Kale are discussing the battle between Goku and Jiren, when they are confronted by Monna (モンナ, Monna), a female warrior from Universe 4. Caulifla faces off against Monna, but Cabba appears and takes her place. He instructs Caulifla and Kale to retreat for now. Cabba turns Super Saiyan and battles Monna, but he is initially overpowered. Monna almost knocks Cabba off the stage, but Vegeta intervenes and catches him before he can fall. Vegeta and Cabba both promise that, if either of them wins the tournament, the winner will use the Super Dragon Balls to restore the other's erased universe and its inhabitants. Newly inspired, Cabba fights Monna again, but he is losing until he taps into his anger and unlocks Super Saiyan 2. With his new power, Cabba easily defeats and eliminates Monna. However, Frieza appears, fights Cabba, and easily eliminates him as well. Frieza reveals that he plans to win the tournament in order to use the Super Dragon Balls to control the gods. Meanwhile, Vegeta decides to challenge Jiren, but he is intercepted by Toppo. The two battle each other. Vegeta ends up meeting up with Goku, who is still having difficulty with his three opponents. However, Caulifla intervenes and knocks Koitsukai, Borareta, and Pancea away before powering up to Super Saiyan 2 and challenging Goku herself. 113 37 "With Great Joy ! The Repeat Battle-Crazy Saiyan Fight ! !" "Kiki to Shite ! Sentō-kyō Saiya-jin Batoru Futatabi ! !" (嬉々 として ! 戦闘 狂 サイヤ 人 バトル 再び ! !) October 29, 2017 TBA Caulifla demands that Goku fight her and teach her how to unlock Super Saiyan 3 so that she can become strong enough to win the tournament. She begins fighting Goku, who does not initially power up beyond his base form. However, Goku's superior martial arts skills allow him to keep up with her even in her Super Saiyan 2 form. Eventually, she is able to adapt to his moves, which forces Goku to power up to Super Saiyan 2 himself. The two of them fight evenly for some time. Goku later calls in Kale to join the battle. His superior power and skill enables him to fight them both at once, but they are able to match him by working together. They land a massive combined attack on him, but Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 3 and easily deflects their attacks. However, Goku lacks the stamina to maintain that form and reverts to Super Saiyan 2. Kale's desire to become stronger inadvertently causes her to transform into her Berserker Super Saiyan form again. 114 38 "Intimidating Passion ! The Birth of a New Super Warrior ! !" "Kiki semaru ! Aratana chō sen-shi no bakutan ! !" (鬼気 せまる ! 新た な 超 戦士 の 爆誕 ! !) November 5, 2017 TBA Vegeta continues his battle with Toppo, while Caulifla is able to help Kale regain control of her Berserker form. Caulifla and Kale battle Goku together and are able to hold him off. Meanwhile, Frieza is confronted by Katopesla, but they are interrupted by Goku's battle with Caulifla and Kale. Frieza wants to fight Caulifla and Kale, but Goku insists that he will fight them himself. Frieza backs down and watches the fight. The three Saiyans resume their battle. After unsuccessfully attempting to use Instant Transmission as a strategy, Goku powers up to his Super Saiyan God form and easily overpowers the two of them. As Goku prepares to eliminate Caulifla and Kale with a powerful Kamehameha, it is revealed that the girls were given a pair of Potara earrings by Fuwa, Universe 6's Supreme Kai. They use the earrings and fuse to become a single being with immense power, who takes the name Kefla (ケフラ, Kefura). 115 39 "Goku VS Kefla ! Super Saiyan Blue Defeated ? !" "Gokū vāsasu Kefura ! Sūpāsaiya-jin Burū Yabureru ! ?" (悟空 VS ケフラ ! 超 サイヤ 人 ブルー 敗れる ! ?) November 12, 2017 TBA As Vegeta continues to fight Toppo, Gohan and Piccolo are engaged with Saonel and Pirina. No. 18 is attacked by Katopesla, but she is saved by No. 17. Meanwhile, Goku continues his fight with Kefla. The Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō approve Kefla's use of the Potara earrings. The other universes consider giving the Potara to their warriors as well. Pell (ペル, Peru), the Supreme Kai of Universe 2, gives his Potara to Rabanra (ラバンラ, Rabanra) and Zarbuto (ザーブト, Zābuto), but the earrings are destroyed by Kefla charging through them to continue fighting Goku. The battle becomes intense with Kefla gaining the upper hand. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue, but Kefla counters by powering up to Super Saiyan. However, Goku uses the Kaioken and regains the advantage. He appears to be winning, but Kefla lands a sneak attack that knocks him out of Super Saiyan Blue. She prepares to eliminate him, but Goku unexpectedly reawakens Ultra Instinct again and easily dodges her attacks. 116 40 "The Sign of a Comeback ! Ultra Instinct's Huge Explosion ! !" "Gyakuten no kizashi ! Migatte no gokui ga dai bakuhatsu ! !" (逆転 の 兆し ! 身勝手 の 極意 が 大 爆発 ! !) November 19, 2017 TBA To counter Goku's increase in power, Kefla powers up to Super Saiyan 2, and the two of them face off. Goku still easily dodges Kefla's attacks, but his own attacks are not strong enough to take her down. Whis explains that when Goku launches his attacks, it interferes with his concentration and prevents him from using Ultra Instinct to its full potential. Jiren senses the energy from the battle, which prompts him to awaken from his meditation and rejoin Toppo and Dyspo. Vegeta realizes that Ultra Instinct is the level of skill that Whis was training him and Goku to attain, and decides that he must reach it too. Goku begins running low on stamina, so he declares that he will end the fight with his next attack. Kefla panics and unleashes a multitude of deadly energy beams. Her ultimate attack devastates the ring, but Goku easily dodges her blasts while charging a Kamehameha. Goku jumps into the air, so Kefla focuses all of her power into a single blast and launches it at him, taking advantage of his apparent inability to dodge. However, he backflips and uses the charged-up energy to slide over her attack, and launches his Kamehameha at point-blank range, blasting Kefla out of the ring and eliminating her. Her Potara earrings shatter, and she splits back into Kale and Caulifla. With both of them eliminated, Saonel and Pirina are the only remaining warriors from Team Universe 6. NOTE: This episode was dedicated in memory of Hiromi Tsuru, who passed away on November 16, 2017. 117 41 "Showdown of Love ! Androids VS Universe 2 ! !" "Ai no daikessen ! Jinzōningen VS Dai ni uchū ! !" (愛 の 大 決戦 ! 人造 人間 VS 第 2 宇宙 ! !) November 26, 2017 TBA Goku is left exhausted from his battle with Kefla. He is confronted by all five remaining warriors from Universe 2. Gohan and Piccolo try to help him, but they are intercepted by Saonel and Pirina. Elsewhere, Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and tries to unlock Ultra Instinct against him. However, he is unsuccessful, and resorts to his normal fighting style. Vegeta easily overpowers Katopesla. Rozie and Ribrianne launch a combined attack at Goku, but No. 17 and No. 18 arrive in time to deflect it. The androids battle Rozie and Ribrianne. No. 17 defeats and eliminates Rozie, while No. 18 knocks Ribrianne out of her powered-up transformation. This causes her to revert into Brianne. Brianne is able to catch No. 18 in an energy trap, while her comrades from Universe 2 send their love to her. This allows Brianne to transform into a giant manifestation of her Super Ribrianne form. No. 18 almost gives up until her love for Krillin and Marron gives her the determination to break free of Ribrianne's trap. With No. 17's help, No. 18 blasts through Ribrianne's giant form and eliminates her. Brianne realizes that she lost because of No. 18's strong love for Krillin, while Goku faces off against Zirloin (ザーロイン, Zāroin), Zarbuto, and Rabanra of Universe 2. 118 42 "Accelerated Tragedy Vanishing Universes." "Kasokusuru Higeki Kieyuku Uchū." (加速 する 悲劇 消え ゆく 宇宙.) December 3, 2017 TBA Goku battles against Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra from Universe 2, while Gohan and Piccolo are fighting against Saonel and Pirina. Saonel and Pirina's power suddenly increases, and it is revealed that they had each fused with many Namekians from their universe before coming to the tournament, which greatly increased their own powers. No. 17 and No. 18 join Goku to help in the battle against the remaining Universe 2 warriors. It is revealed that Universe 2's angel, Sour (サワア, Sawaa), has been broadcasting the tournament to the populace of their universe. Universe 2's inhabitants channel their love to Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, who are able to transform into forms similar to Ribrianne, Rozie, and Kakunsa's transformed states. Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 battle Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo continue fighting Saonel and Pirina. The Universe 2 trio unleash a legendary Universe 2 technique, the Pretty Black Hole, which traps and threatens to sink Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 through the fighting stage. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue and breaks through the Pretty Black Hole with a Kamehameha that eliminates Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo blast Saonel and Pirina off the ring with a powerful combined attack that eliminates them as well. With all of their fighters eliminated, both Universe 2 and Universe 6 are erased. Brianne leads the Universe 2 team in a final happy moment before their erasure, while Cabba wishes Vegeta good luck. Champa taunts Beerus before being erased. Beerus remains impassive in the face of his brother's erasure. Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and warns him that he is in a bad mood. 119 43 "Unavoidable ? ! The Fierce Stealth Attack ! !" "Kaihi funō ! ? Suterusu kōgeki no mōi ! !" (回避 不能 ! ? ステルス 攻撃 の 猛威 ! !) December 10, 2017 TBA Vegeta overpowers Katopesla and drives him to the edge of the ring. Katopesla is able to catch himself, but he is pushed over the edge and eliminated by an unseen force. Vegeta and Gohan are attacked by the same force, but Vegeta is able to stop himself from going over the edge, while Piccolo catches Gohan. No. 18 is attacked by the invisible fighter, who is revealed to be one of the missing Universe 4 fighters, Gamisaras (ガミサラス, Gamisarasu). Gohan creates a cloud of dust that coats Gamisaras, which allows Piccolo to see him. Piccolo easily eliminates Gamisaras. Undaunted, Quitela orders the remaining Universe 4 fighters to step up their game. Shantza (シャンツァ, Shantsa) generates a dome that envelops the Universe 7 team and manifests illusions of the defeated fighters from the erased universes. However, Piccolo spots Shantza and blasts him off the ring, which eliminates him and destroys the illusions. Universe 4's last fighter, Damon (ダモン, Damon), is also assumed to be invisible since no one can see him. Piccolo is able to sense Damon's attacks, but he proves unable to hit Damon, who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him. No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug-like creature rather than an invisible person, which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him. To solve this problem, Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air, which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts. No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him. With all of their fighters eliminated, Universe 4 is promptly erased. 120 44 "The Perfect Survival Tactic ! Universe 3's Menacing Assassin ! !" "Kanpeki na Seizon Senryaku ! Dai san Uchū Kyōi no Shikaku ! !" (完璧 なる 生存 戦略 ! 第 3 宇宙 脅威 の 刺客 ! !) December 17, 2017 TBA Following the elimination of Universe 4, the remaining fighters from Universe 3 take the offensive against Universe 7. While Viara is defeated and eliminated by No. 17 and No. 18's combined efforts, Paparoni (パパロニ, Paparoni) sends Panchia, Koitsukai, and Bollarator to attack Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta. To help Goku and Vegeta save their energy to confront Universe 11, Gohan decides to face the three robots alone. He gains the upper hand until Paparoni has them combine together into a much stronger robot called Koichiarator (コイチアレータ, Koichiarēta). Koichiarator overpowers Gohan until Goku and Vegeta step in. The two distract the enemy, while Gohan charges and strikes with an attack powerful enough to defeat it. With his robots defeated, Paparoni refuses to surrender and declares that he will unleash his trump card on Universe 7. 121 45 "All-Out War ! The Ultimate Quadruple Merge vs Universe 7's Full-Scale Attack ! !" "Sōryokusen ! Kyūkoku no Yontai Gattai VS Dai nana Uchū Sōkōgeki ! !" (総力 戦 ! 究極 の 4 体 合体 VS 第 7 宇宙 総 攻撃 ! !) December 24, 2017 TBA Paparoni and Koichiarator merge to form Anilaza (アニラーザ, Anirāza), the most powerful warrior from Universe 3. Anilaza begins to overwhelm the Saiyans, which forces No. 17 and No. 18 to reinforce them. The five attempt to coordinate their attacks to catch Anilaza off-guard, but he deflects them all. It is revealed that Anilaza can use echolocation to detect his opponents ' movements. Anilaza begins teleporting his punches, and he nearly knocks Goku off the stage until Frieza steps in and knocks him back onto the fighting stage. Realizing that the Universe 7 warriors will rescue each other from defeat, Anilaza attempts to eat No. 18, who is rescued by Goku. Anilaza corners No. 17 and overwhelms him. He knocks him off the fighting stage, but No. 18 sacrifices herself to kick No. 17 back onto the fighting stage. She is eliminated from the tournament. With no other options, the Universe 7 warriors power up to their maximum levels and engage in a ki clash with Anilaza. They buy time for No. 17 to pierce through Anilaza's attack and damage his energy reactor. This enables the others to overwhelm and eliminate Anilaza. With all of their warriors eliminated, Universe 3 is erased. As the Universe 7 warriors begin to celebrate, the remaining Universe 11 warriors step forward to challenge them. 122 46 "For One's Own Pride ! Vegeta's Challenge to Be The Strongest ! !" "Onore no Hokori wo Kakete ! Bejīta Saikyō he no Chōsen ! !" (己 の 誇り を かけ て ! ベジータ 最強 へ の 挑戦 ! !) January 7, 2018 TBA With only two universes remaining, the Grand Minister compresses the bleachers so that the remaining spectators are all close together. The final warriors begin their battle: Gohan and No. 17 battle Toppo, Frieza fights Dyspo, and Goku and Vegeta battle Jiren. Jiren overwhelms Goku with a flurry of punches, but Vegeta is able to analyze Jiren's attack patterns and dodges his attacks. He lands a solid blow to Jiren's midsection, but Jiren counters with a powerful blast that nearly rings Vegeta out. Meanwhile, Frieza blocks one of Dyspo's attacks with his tail, but Dyspo uses it as leverage to injure him. Jiren disparages Vegeta for his self-righteousness, but Vegeta declares that it is the source of his strength. He powers up a Final Flash and goads Jiren into taking it head-on. However, the attack fails to damage Jiren, who acknowledges the power of Vegeta's attack before incapacitating him. 123 47 "Body and Soul, Full Power Release ! Goku and Vegeta ! !" "Zenshin Zenrei Zenryoku Kaihō ! Gokū to Bejīta ! !" (全身 全霊 全力 解放 ! 悟空 と ベジータ ! !) January 14, 2018 TBA With Vegeta down, Goku faces off against Jiren. Meanwhile, the other battles continue. Frieza decides to start fighting Dyspo seriously, while Gohan and No. 17 are outmatched against Toppo. Outmatched in power, Goku instead uses ki blasts to create a minefield around Jiren, but it has no effect. Goku then lures Jiren onto a large rock that extends out over the edge of the fighting stage and cuts through the rock with a Destructo Disc. This causes Jiren to fall, but Jiren is able to push off the falling debris and jumps back onto the fighting stage. Angered by his near-elimination, Jiren finally shows his real power and easily overwhelms Goku with a volley of punches. Goku and Vegeta both get back up and power up to Super Saiyan Blue. Goku uses his maximum Kaioken beyond his previous limitations, while Vegeta is able to surpass his limits by tapping into more ki in his body, and attains a transformation similar to the Ascended Super Saiyan form, the Super Saiyan Blue Evolution form. Fully powered up, Goku and Vegeta attack Jiren as a team, and they are able to catch him off guard with their un-coordinated attacks. 124 48 "The Fiercely Overwhelming Assault ! Gohan's Last Stand ! !" "Shippū-Dotō no Mōshū ! Gohan Haisui no Jin ! !" (疾風 怒涛 の 猛襲 ! 悟 飯 背水 の 陣 ! !) January 21, 2018 TBA As Goku and Vegeta continue their battle with Jiren, the battle between Dyspo and Frieza intensifies. The two seem evenly matched, until Frieza breaks off the fight and offers to help Universe 11 win the tournament if they promise to resurrect him with the Super Dragon Balls. Dyspo refuses the offer, so Frieza powers up to his Golden form and gains the advantage in the fight. Dyspo reveals his own ultimate technique, the Super Maximum Light Speed Mode, which increases his power and speed even further, and overwhelms Frieza. Gohan and No. 17 realize that Frieza is in danger of being knocked off the fighting stage, so No. 17 distracts Toppo, while Gohan goes to Frieza's aid. Gohan and Frieza take on Dyspo as a team, but they have little success. Gohan develops a strategy that has Frieza use his energy to form a cage around Dyspo, which prevents him from using his high-speed attacks and allows Gohan to gain the upper hand. Unfortunately, Frieza runs out of energy, and the cage dissolves before Gohan can land the finishing blow. However, Gohan is able to grab Dyspo and hold him in place, while Frieza launches a blast that knocks them off the fighting stage and eliminates them both from the tournament. 125 49 "With Imposing Presence ! God of Destruction Toppo Descends ! !" "Ifu-Dōdō ! Hakaishin Toppo Kōrin !" (威風 堂々 ! 破壊 神 トッポ 降臨 ! !) January 28, 2018 TBA Goku and Vegeta continue their battle with Jiren, while No. 17 and Toppo fight. No. 17 and Toppo engage in a beam clash, which Toppo is winning. Frieza intervenes and strikes Toppo repeatedly from behind, which allows No. 17 to overpower Toppo's blast. In the wake of the explosion, Toppo appears to have been defeated. However, he gets back up and powers up, using the same type of energy as a God of Destruction. Belmod explains that Toppo is a candidate to be Universe 11's next God of Destruction, which is why he can wield the same kind of power. Toppo unleashes his new power, which damages the fighting stage and breaks a large portion of it. No. 17 and Frieza attack Toppo repeatedly, but his power is now far superior to theirs. Toppo easily defeats them both. Fortunately, they are able to stay on the fighting stage, but Toppo knocks Frieza unconscious and engages in another beam clash with No. 17. 126 50 "Surpass Even a God ! Vegeta's Desperate Blow ! !" "Kami wo mo Koero ! Bejīta Sutemi no Ichigeki ! !" (神 を も 超えろ ! ベジータ 捨て身 の 一撃 ! !) February 4, 2018 TBA Toppo easily overpowers No. 17's blast. No. 17 is able to evade him for a while by using the broken fighting stage to his advantage, but Toppo effortlessly withstands No. 17's attacks. Toppo prepares to eliminate No. 17 with a giant energy blast. Frieza rejoins the battle and deflects Toppo's attack. Frieza uses his own energy attack to immobilize Toppo, which allows him and No. 17 to land numerous attacks, but none of them have any effect. Toppo is about to eliminate them both, when he is interrupted by Goku and Vegeta, who are still fighting Jiren. Frieza and No. 17 are hit by one of Jiren's attacks, which gives Toppo the opportunity to attack Vegeta instead. Toppo overwhelms Vegeta with his new power and states that he has cast aside everything else in order to become strong enough to win the tournament. However, Vegeta is inspired by his family, his promise to Cabba, and his Saiyan pride. He refuses to cast anything aside. Vegeta unleashes his full power and overwhelms Toppo. Vegeta and Toppo both use their ultimate attacks: Toppo unleashes his Energy of Destruction, while Vegeta uses the Final Explosion technique that he used against Majin Buu. Vegeta's attack overwhelms Toppo's attack, blasts Toppo out of the fighting stage, and eliminates him from the tournament. This also causes even more damage to the fighting stage. Due to Vegeta being much stronger than the last time he used the Final Explosion technique, he survives the blast, but his energy is almost completely drained. No. 17 also reappears, but he has been injured by Jiren's attack. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all face off against Jiren, who begins to unleash his full power. 127 51 "The Approaching Wall ! The Final Barrier of Hope ! !" "Semari-kuru Shōheki ! Kibō wo Takushita Saigo no Baria ! !" (迫り くる 障壁 ! 希望 を 託 した 最後 の バリア ! !) February 11, 2018 TBA Jiren powers up to his maximum. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all attack him simultaneously, but he easily overpowers them. However, No. 17 manages to land a sneak attack and injures Jiren. Jiren defeats Goku and Vegeta, while Frieza rejoins the fight and tries to kill Jiren in his golden form. However, Frieza is easily defeated as well. No. 17 asks Jiren what his wish on the Super Dragon Balls would be, and Belmod explains that Jiren's endless pursuit of strength was inspired when his parents, most of his comrades, and mentor were killed by a powerful villain. However, his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship, and he now focuses solely on increasing his own strength. No. 17 admires Jiren's human qualities, but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe's team for his own ends. Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17, Goku, and Vegeta. No. 17 uses a barrier to hold back Jiren's blast and forms force fields around Goku and Vegeta to protect them, before self-destructing to destroy Jiren's blast. Despite his exhausted state, Vegeta faces off against Jiren and declares that he will defeat him. 128 52 "Noble Pride to the End ! Vegeta Falls ! !" "Kedakai Hokori Saigo Made ! Bejīta Chiru ! !" (気高い 誇り 最後 まで ! ベジータ 散る ! !) February 18, 2018 TBA Vegeta prepares for a final stand against Jiren. Although Vegeta is too exhausted to turn into even a Super Saiyan, he still decides to take on Jiren. Jiren easily dodges his attacks and continues to pummel Vegeta. Jiren injures Vegeta's left eye in the process. Vegeta is knocked to the brink of elimination, and he begins to think about the people in his life he cares about the most. He gets back up and continues to fight Jiren, who is impressed by Vegeta's pride. Vegeta nearly rings out again. His boot catches onto a floating piece of rubble, which narrowly allows him to stay in the fight because the pieces of rubble still count as part of the fighting stage. Vegeta hears Bulma's voice urging him to fight on, and he returns to fight Jiren once again. Jiren is unable to understand why Vegeta continues to fight him. Vegeta fires off a Final Flash, but Jiren is unfazed. Jiren knocks Vegeta out of the fighting stage and eliminates him from the tournament. Although Vegeta is upset at being unable to last until the end, he gives Goku his remaining energy at the last second before falling out of bounds. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and begins to fight Jiren with his remaining power. Even with Vegeta's energy, Goku is still overwhelmed by Jiren. He is knocked back into his base form. When Goku is pushed back to the edge of the fighting stage and only one punch away from defeat, Vegeta shouts at Goku. Goku thinks about how the others have all put their faith in him. As Jiren delivers the final blow, Goku suddenly reactivates Ultra Instinct and dodges the attack. With his new power, Goku is able to effortlessly dodge Jiren's attacks and lands a heavy blow on him. Both fighters face off and prepare for their final battle. 129 53 "Limits Super Surpassed ! Ultra Instinct Mastered ! !" "Genkai Chōzetsu Toppa ! Migatte no Gokui Kiwamaru ! !"

March 4, 2018 TBA Whis points out that, since Goku has no allies to help him and no time to recover from the strain caused by Ultra Instinct, this will be his last chance to end the battle. Goku and Jiren resume their battle, but Goku has the same problem he experienced with Kefla, and is unable to attack at his full potential. Goku tries the same trick he used on Kefla by powering up a Kamehameha and firing it at Jiren, but Jiren is able to punch through the blast. Belmod is confident that Goku's incomplete Ultra Instinct will not be enough to win, but Vegeta points out that, throughout the tournament, all of the Saiyans have been able to surpass their limits and achieve higher levels of power. Jiren is able to trap Goku on a single floating rock and fires a barrage of attacks down at him in an attempt to knock him out, but Goku begins blocking Jiren's attacks with his own punches. Jiren launches a final blast down at Goku, but Goku suddenly powers up immensely. He easily blocks Jiren's blast and jumps back up to the fighting stage. Jiren attacks again, but this time Goku easily overpowers him with a flurry of punches. Whis reveals that Goku has completed his ascension. Goku's hair and eyes have turned silver, and he now has full mastery over Ultra Instinct. 130 54 "The Greatest Showdown of All Time ! The Ultimate Survival Battle ! !" "Kūzenzetsugo no Chō Kessen ! Kyūkyoku no Sabaibaru Batoru ! !" (空前 絶後 の 超 決戦 ! 究極 の サバイバル バトル ! !) March 18, 2018 TBA Having mastered Ultra Instinct, Goku overpowers and corners Jiren, which forces Jiren to break through his own limits and power up even further. The two exchange attacks continuously. Despite almost being defeated twice, Goku stands up and recovers. When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept it, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers that is repelled by a furious Goku, who finally defeats him. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Ultra Instinct for too long. Jiren takes the opportunity to knock Goku off the fighting stage, but Goku is saved by Frieza. No. 17 is also revealed to have survived Jiren's blast. As Frieza and No. 17 prepare themselves to face Jiren, Goku writhes in pain. 131 55 "The Miraculous Conclusion ! Farewell, Goku ! Until We Meet Again !" "Kiseki no ketchaku ! Saraba Goku ! Mataauhimade ! !" (奇跡 の 決着 ! さらば 悟空 ! また 会う 日 まで ! !) March 25, 2018 TBA With Goku down, Frieza and No. 17 face off against Jiren. No. 17 manages to injure Jiren, who collapses from exhaustion. Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Toppo calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up and fires a massive blast at Frieza and No. 17. They form a barrier to shield themselves, but Frieza is running low on energy and loses his Golden form. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier and enables them to block Jiren's blast. Goku and Frieza take on Jiren together, while No. 17 provides cover fire. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him out of the ring. All three of them are eliminated from the tournament. With all of their fighters gone, Universe 11 is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the fighting stage, No. 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power, and he is given the privilege of getting his wish granted from the Super Dragon Balls. After some consideration, No. 17 wishes to restore all of the universes that had been erased, which brings all their inhabitants back to life. As the erased universes are restored, the Grand Minister reveals that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had foresaw the outcome of a virtuous being winning the Tournament of Power who would make a selfless wish on the Super Dragon Balls. He also stated that they would have otherwise erased the entire multiverse if the winner had wished for selfish reasons, as this would have shown that the winning universe was no better than the erased universes and that the universes excluded from the tournament were not equally worthy of existing. As a reward for doing well in the tournament, Whis restores Frieza to life. In Universe 11, Jiren establishes a real friendship with Toppo and looks forward to having a rematch with Goku someday. The group from Universe 7 return home. Frieza leaves Earth and resumes leadership of his empire. Goku vows to defeat him if he starts causing trouble again. Goku and Vegeta meet for a sparring match in the place where they first fought. Goku reveals that he can not use Ultra Instinct anymore and believes that he obtained it by accident during the tournament. Goku and Vegeta declare that they will keep finding new levels of strength. They race towards each other to fight.<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Ground truth: Overall No. Saga No. English translation Original Japanese title Original airdate American airdate 77 "Let's Do It, Zen-Oh Sama ! The All-Universe Martial Arts Tournament ! !" "Yarou ze Zenō-sama ! Uchū ichi Budō-kai ! !" (や ろう ぜ 全 王様 ! 宇宙 一 武道 会 ! !) February 5, 2017 TBA The Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō are playing a game together in their realm, but both have become bored with their monotonous routine. Meanwhile, Goku heads to a local farmer's market to sell his produce and get Chi-Chi off his back about making money. On the way home, he is ambushed by some robbers. Goku defeats them, but he is injured in the process. Deciding that he has grown rusty, Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis. They head to the Capsule Corporation building, where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta's second child. Goten remains behind to train with Trunks. Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth. Goku heads to Beerus ' planet alone. While training with Whis, Goku remembers Grand Zenō's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament. Heedless of Beerus and Whis ' warnings, Goku uses Grand Zenō's button to head to his realm and convinces Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament. When he returns to Beerus ' planet, Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Grand Zenō naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse. Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again. Goku, Beerus, and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais, where the Grand Minister arrives. He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the "Tournament of Power" (力 の 大会, Chikara no Taikai). 78 "The Gods of Every Universe in Shock ? ! Losers Erased in the Tournament of Power" "Zen uchū no kami-sama mo don hiki ! ? Maketara shōmetsu "Chikara no taikai"" (全 宇宙 の 神様 も ドン 引き ! ? 負け たら 消滅 「 力 の 大会 」) February 12, 2017 TBA The Grand Minister explains the details of the "Tournament of Power" and states that it will be held on "the World of Void". It is a place of "infinite nothingness", where the competitors can fight without limits. The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls, while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence. Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty. Goku suggests asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to ignore it, but Whis advises against this. Whis tells Goku that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous. Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament in the first place. Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces. The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zenō's benefit. Each universe is to name three fighters. Goku sets off to recruit teammates. After Vegeta refuses, Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu, who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7. Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan. Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic. Back at Grand Zenō's and Future Grand Zenō's palace, all the gods from all 12 universes gather. The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match. He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament. In the first round, Majin Buu is to fight Basil (バジル, Bajiru), a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9. 79 "Universe 9's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7's Majin Buu ! !" "Dai kyu uchū keri no Bajiru basasu Dai nana uchū Majinbū ! !" (第 9 宇宙 蹴り の バジル VS 第 7 宇宙 魔 人 ブウ ! !) February 19, 2017 TBA Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh (ロウ, Rō), the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender (ラベンダ, Rabenda) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match. Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender. 80 "Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit ! Son Gohan's Fight ! !" "Nemutta tōshi o yobisamase ! Son Gohan no tatakai ! !" (眠っ た 闘志 を 呼び覚ませ ! 孫 悟 飯 の 闘い ! !) February 26, 2017 TBA As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well. However, Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong. Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had long believed that there were too many universes. He was planning to erase most of them anyway, but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared. With the announcement concluded, the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo (ベルガモ, Berugamo), Basil's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine. 81 5 "Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku ! Which One Wields the Limitless Power ? !" "Tsubushi no Berugamo VS Son Gokū ! Aotenjō no tsuyosa wa dotchida ! ?" (潰し の ベルガモ VS 孫悟空 ! 青 天井 の 強 さ は どっち だ ! ?) March 5, 2017 TBA Before their battle begins, Bergamo denounces Goku before the assembled gods. Bergamo pleads with Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased. Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle. Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō will immediately erase all of the universes. Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms. When the fight begins, Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed. Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times, but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku's attacks. He grows stronger and physically larger. Goku continues to attack, which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight. Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue, which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha. Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure, but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge. The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin. The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner. Suddenly, a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo (トッポ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle. Goku, who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo, agrees to fight Toppo. 82 6 "Never Forgive Son Goku ! Toppo the Warrior of Justice Intrudes ! !" "Son Gokū yurusumaji ! Seigi no senshi Toppo ran'nyū ! ! !" (孫悟空 許す まじ ! 正義 の 戦士 トッポ 乱入 ! !) March 19, 2017 TBA After obtaining Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō blessing to proceed, Goku and Toppo begin their battle. Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku's shoulder. Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows, but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug. He begins squeezing the life out of Goku, which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape. Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha. Just as the two power up even more, the Grand Minister puts an end to the fight. As Toppo leaves, he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren (ジレン). The Grand Minister begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power. In the Sacred World of the Kais, Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku's constant relaxed and negligent attitude, which Whis breaks up. The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy. 83 7 "Form the Universe 7 Representing Team ! Who are the Strongest Ten ? !" "Dai-7 uchū daihyō chīmu o kessei seyo ! Saikyō no 10-ri wa dareda ?" (第 7 宇宙 代表 チーム を 結成 せよ ! 最強 の 10 人 は 誰 だ ! ?) March 26, 2017 TBA Goku and the others arrive at Capsule Corporation. They discuss who should be on the team. Goku immediately suggests Monaka, but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and can not participate. Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta, Piccolo, Krillin, Master Roshi, No. 18, and No. 17, which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine. Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience. They proceed to ask Vegeta, who has been thinking of a name for his second child. Vegeta refuses to participate. He says he will not fight, while Bulma is pregnant. Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight. Everyone celebrates the baby's birth. Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother. As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta, he develops an attachment to her. Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot. However, Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla's name. Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin's house. 84 8 "Son Goku the Recruiter Invites Krillin and No. 18" "Sukautoman Son Gokū--Kuririn to 18-gō o izanau" (スカウト マン 孫悟空 クリリン と 18 号 を 誘う) April 2, 2017 TBA Goku and Gohan arrive at Krillin's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power. No. 18 convinces Krillin to participate in order to put his newfound martial arts training to use. No. 18 is reluctant to join herself. She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them, but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward, which convinces her to participate. Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast. After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat, Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea. Goku is excited by Krillin's new power. He challenges him to a sparring match as well. They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan, where Krillin's strategies make up for the gap in power, forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form, and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash. As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin, No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku's Kamehameha, just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion. She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku can not expect to fight one-on-one all the time. Goku concedes the match and realizes he will have to adjust his tactics in order to win the Tournament of Power. No. 18 reveals that No. 17 is currently working at a wildlife reserve, but she does not know where. Goku decides to ask Dende to find No. 17. 85 9 "The Universes Begin to Make Their Moves Their Individual Motives" "Ugokidasu uchū--sorezore no omowaku" (動き出す 宇宙--それぞれ の 思惑) April 9, 2017 TBA Gohan leaves to recruit Piccolo, while Goku prepares to head to the Lookout. He encounters Majin Buu and Mr. Satan training. Goku discovers that Buu has lost weight and has gotten much slimmer in appearance. The two spar together. Buu defeats Goku by overwhelming him with ki blasts and knocking him out of the fighting stage. Meanwhile, Khai (カイ), the Supreme Kai of Universe 11, gathers all of the Supreme Kais involved in the tournament except for Universe 7's, who is ostracized due to Goku's involvement with the creation of the tournament. Khai asks his fellow Supreme Kais to request that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō cancel the erasure of the universes, but they are all too afraid of his wrath to do so. Champa gathers all the Gods of Destruction involved in the tournament except Beerus after finding out about the Supreme Kai's meeting, and they discuss Goku. Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers Kahseral (カーセラル, Kāseraru) and Dyspo (ディスポ, Disupo). Champa recruits Cabba and demands he find more powerful Saiyans. Goku meets Dende and Mr. Popo at the Lookout and learns No. 17's location. Gohan prepares to train with Piccolo. 86 10 "Fist Cross for the First Time ! Android # 17 VS Son Goku ! !" "Hajimete majiwaru kobushi ! Jinzōningen Jūnana-gō VS Son Gokū ! !" (初めて 交わる 拳 ! 人造 人間 17 号 VS 孫悟空 ! !) April 16, 2017 TBA On their way to the island where No. 17 is working, Dende explains that since the conclusion of the Cell Games, No. 17 has started a family and gotten far stronger. Dende also reveals that Kid Buu has reincarnated as a young Earthling with massive fighting potential and asks Goku to train him when he is old enough. They reach the island as Goku arrives just in time to witness No. 17 defeat a group of armed poachers. As they introduce themselves to each other, a large army of poachers arrive. Goku and No. 17 team up to subdue them all. Afterwards, No. 17 explains that the poachers are after the last Minotaurus in order to steal its rare and valuable horns. The two decide to have a sparring match. No. 17 evenly matches Super Saiyan Goku, which causes him to turn Super Saiyan Blue. Goku launches a Kamehameha at No. 17, who easily deflects it with an energy shield. The two go toe-to-toe until No. 17 ends the match in order to avoid catching the island in the crossfire. Goku and No. 17 acknowledge that they were both holding back in the fight. Afterwards, Goku attempts to convince him to join the Tournament of Power, but No. 17 is uninterested. He remains indifferent even when Goku reveals that the losing universes will be erased. Meanwhile, alien poachers arrive on Earth and they set their sights on the Minotaurus. 87 11 "Hunt the Poachers ! Goku and No. 17's United Front ! !" "Mitsuryō-dan o kare ! Gokū to Jūnana-gō no kyōtō ! !" (密漁 団 を 狩れ ! 悟空 と 17 号 の 共闘 ! !) April 23, 2017 TBA Goku entices No. 17 with a wish on the Super Dragon Balls. As he begins to consider Goku's offer, the alien poachers arrive and abduct all of the island's animals. Goku uses his Instant Transmission to teleport himself and No. 17 aboard their ship before it can escape. After defeating some of the poachers, No. 17 sets off to defeat the leader, while Goku remains behind to battle the rest of the poachers. No. 17 confronts and easily defeats the leader. Goku catches up just as the leader pulls out a switch and threatens to self-destruct if he is not released immediately. No. 17 smashes him out of a window, which vents both of them into deep space. Goku manages to use his Instant Transmission to teleport all three of them to King Kai's world. Dende contacts Goku and informs him that the leader's threat was a bluff. Afterwards, Goku and No. 17 return the animals to their rightful homes. Jaco arrives to arrest the alien poachers. No. 17 decides to leave his island in the hands of Goten and Trunks and accepts Goku's offer to fight in the Tournament of Power. He hopes to use the Super Dragon Balls to wish for an expensive boat and travel the world with his family. 88 12 "Gohan and Piccolo Teacher and Pupil Clash in Max Training !" "Gohan to Pikkoro Shitei gekitotsu no Genkai shugyō !" (悟 飯 と ピッコロ 師弟 激突 の 限界 修業 !) April 30, 2017 TBA Gohan and Piccolo engage in intense training. Piccolo explains that Goku has already informed him about the potential erasure of the universe and that he is going to participate in the Tournament of Power. He points out that Gohan's over eagerness to protect his loved ones is making him reckless. Gohan transforms into a Super Saiyan, and the two continue to spar. Meanwhile, Cabba heads to the residence of his retired captain and mentor, Renso (レンソウ). Cabba asks him to join Universe 6's team for the Tournament of Power, but Renso refuses due to an injury to his leg. Renso suggests his sister, Caulifla (カリフラ, Karifura), instead, who he claims is even stronger than him. Back in Universe 7, Piccolo removes his weighted clothes to go all out and quickly defeats Gohan. Piccolo explains that Gohan has a tendency to become arrogant when he has the advantage in battle. After being encouraged by Piccolo, Gohan manages to reach the level of power he had against Super Buu. The two fight again, and Gohan successfully severs Piccolo's arm. However, Piccolo blasts him in the back with the severed arm and defeats Gohan, which proves Piccolo's point about Gohan's overconfidence. That night, Piccolo vows to push Gohan to new heights of power. They both agree to work on combination moves. 89 13 "An Unknown Beauty Appears ! The Tenshin-Style Dojo's Mystery ? !"

May 7, 2017 TBA Goku heads to Master Roshi's island, where Oolong informs him that Tien and Chiaotzu have started a martial arts dojo, and that Roshi has headed there to act as a special instructor. Goku decides to make Tien the tenth member of the team, and heads off to recruit him and Roshi. At Tien's dojo, a woman named Yurin (ユーリン, Yūrin) with a grudge against Tien arrives and requests to join the dojo. Although Tien denies her because her motivation of beauty was unfit for his dojo, Roshi drags Yurin off to ogle her. Goku arrives and asks Tien to join the Tournament of Power, but, even after Goku bribes him with 10 million Zeni, Tien refuses. Yurin escapes Roshi's advances and uses witchcraft to drive Tien's students on a rampage throughout town. Goku, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Roshi arrive at the village, where Yurin confronts them. Yurin explains that she is a former classmate of Tien's during his time at the Crane School and that she swore revenge on him after he left the school and refused to fight her. Meanwhile, Cabba sways Caulifla into joining Universe 6's team by promising to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. Back on Earth, while Goku, Chiaotzu, and Tien cure the students of their brainwashing, Roshi battles Yurin. He lowers his guard after catching a glimpse of Yurin's panties, which allows her to brainwash him. The brainwashed Roshi quickly defeats Tien, but Goku intervenes. While Chiaotzu temporarily disables Yurin, Goku subdues Roshi with a Kamehameha and cures him of the brainwashing. Tien orders Yurin to apologize to everyone she hurt and offers her a place at his dojo. Tien decides to join the Tournament of Power because he believes that the 10 million Zeni Goku promised will repair the village. After hearing about the 10 million Zeni, Master Roshi quickly agrees to join as well. 90 14 "See The Wall That Must Be Passed ! Goku vs Gohan" "Koerubeki kabe o misuete !

At Gohan's request, Goku and Tien have a fight against Gohan and Piccolo to practice for the tournament. Although Tien views this as a practice match and wants to avoid injuring anyone, Gohan and Goku take the fight seriously. As Gohan fights both his father and Tien, Piccolo spends the time charging a strong technique, which ultimately destroys the mountain fighting stage when it is launched. Tien calls the match off on the grounds that the fighting stage is now destroyed. Although Goku agrees, Gohan requests to have a one-on-one fight against his father. Goku accepts, and Gohan powers up while Goku goes Super Saiyan 2. Although Goku has the upper hand for much of the fight, Gohan turns the tables and begins to overpower Goku. Gohan begs Goku to use his full power. Goku responds by becoming a Super Saiyan Blue and using his Kaio-Ken technique, then defeats Gohan with a single blow. Impressed with his son's improvement, Goku assigns Gohan as the leader of their Universe 7 team.

In Universe 6, Cabba takes Caulifla to a deserted wasteland to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan.

Kale begins to despair over her own uselessness, and it enrages her enough to trigger her transformation into an extremely powerful Berserker Super Saiyan. Kale immediately goes berserk and attacks Cabba. Caulifla quickly deduces that Kale is jealous of her and Cabba's perceived relationship. She denies having any sort of feelings for Cabba. Kale calms down and collapses in Caulifla's arms. Cabba, who is impressed by Kale's power, decides to add her to Universe 6's team. Back in Universe 7, Goku arrives in the afterlife and receives King Yemma's permission to visit Frieza. He explains about the Tournament of Power and asks Frieza to join them. Frieza agrees to aid him on the condition that he be properly resurrected with Earth's Dragon Balls. When Goku hesitates to agree, Frieza goads him by playing to his desire to see how powerful Frieza can become. Goku accepts his terms. In Universe 4, Ganos (ガノス, Ganosu) reports Universe 7's latest actions to Universe 4's God of Destruction Quitela (キテラ, Kitera) and Supreme Kai Kuru (クル). Quitela immediately begins making plans to counter Beerus. 94 18 "The Emperor of Evil Returns ! A Reception of Mysterious Assassins ? !" "Aku no Teiō fukkatsu ! Demukaeru Nazo no Shikaku-tachi ! ?" (悪 の 帝王 復活 ! 出迎える 謎 の 刺客 たち ! ?) June 11, 2017 TBA Quitela contacts Universe 9's God of Destruction Sidra (シドラ, Shidora) and informs him that Universe 7 is planning to use Frieza to assassinate their rivals before the tournament begins and that the only way to counter them is to kill them first. Sidra and Roh agree to have Frieza killed. Meanwhile, Goku returns to the Capsule Corporation to update everyone on his success. As Master Roshi completes his training at Korin's tower, Krillin and No. 18 head to No. 17's island to pick him up and drop off Goten, Trunks, and Marron. Goku goes to Fortuneteller Baba's home, where she completes the ritual to resurrect Frieza. As Goku and Frieza prepare to depart, an army of assassins arrives to claim their heads. Despite the time pressure, Frieza wounds the assassins ' leader, transforms into his Golden form, and prepares for battle. 95 19 "The Worst ! The Most Evil ! Frieza's Rampage ! !" "Saikyō ! Saiaku ! Furīza Ōabare ! !" (最 凶 ! 最悪 ! フリーザ 大 暴れ ! !) June 18, 2017 TBA Frieza explains to Goku that he spent his recent incarceration in Hell undergoing intense mental training to overcome the stamina issues that plagued him during his previous battles with the Z-Fighters. He quickly slaughters most of the assassins, which horrifies Goku. The assassins ' leader, who has been directly empowered by Sidra, attacks Frieza with Sidra's power, but Frieza manages to overcome and hijack the attack. Frieza spitefully uses the attack on Goku and traps him. Frieza tortures and kills the assassins until they reveal that Roh and Sidra hired them. Frieza contacts Universe 9 and offers his services as a defector. Roh and Sidra begin arguing about whether or not to accept him. Roh fears Frieza's psychopathic and treasonous nature, while Sidra wants his power. Sidra is confident he could kill him if he stepped out of line. Their argument buys time for Beerus and Whis to arrive and rescue Goku. Frieza cuts the connection. He begins making plans to use the Tournament of Power to manipulate the gods to suit his own ends. Goku and Frieza have a brief sparring match, which ends in a draw. Goku, Frieza, Beerus, and Whis return to the Capsule Corporation. The Universe 7 team prepare to travel to the World of Void for the Tournament of Power. 96 20 "The Time Is Here ! To The World Of Void For The Fate Of The Universe ! !" "Toki wa kita ! Uchū no Meiun o kake Mu no Kai e ! !" (時 は きた ! 宇宙 の 命運 を かけ 無 の 界 へ ! !) June 25, 2017 TBA In the World of Void, Universes 1, 5, and 8's Gods of Destruction Iwne (イワン, Iwan), Arack (アラク, Araku), and Liquiir (リキュール, Rikīru) have a brief exhibition match to test the durability of the Tournament of Power's fighting stage. Afterwards, the Grand Minister forces them all to clean up their mess and fix the stage. In Universe 7, Gohan and Shin's strategy is to have the team members stick together to conserve energy and use strength of numbers to defeat anyone who attacks them. This suggestion offends Goku and Vegeta's Saiyan pride. Whis transports the team to the World of Void. All of the other universes arrive. Frieza and Frost befriend each other and agree to work together, while Goku singles out Jiren as a potential rival due to his extreme power. As the Grand Minister introduces each team, Universe 4 seemingly has only 8 warriors on their team, which confuses most of Universe 7, except for Tien, who tells No. 18 that he can sense a faint presence. After a speech from the Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō, the 80 warriors prepare for battle. 97 21 "Survive ! The Tournament of Power Begins at Last ! !" "Ikinokore ! Tsui ni kaimaku Chikara no Taikai ! !" (生き残れ ! ついに 開幕 「 力 の 大会 」 ! !) July 2, 2017 TBA The Grand Minister reminds everyone of the rules and officially starts the tournament. A massive free-for-all ensues. Goku targets Toppo, but he is intercepted by Ganos. Disregarding Gohan's plan as well, No. 17, No. 18, Vegeta, and Frieza all jump into the fray. Universe 3 gains an early advantage when Narirama unleashes a spinning attack designed to knock its opponents off the stage, but Hit and Basil disable it. Universe 10's Lilibeu (リリベウ, Ririberu) attacks Basil, but Basil successfully knocks her off the stage. Meanwhile, the five Universe 7 warriors who stayed together are confronted by a gang of warriors from varying universes, but Universe 7 uses teamwork to fend them off. Basil nearly defeats Universe 10's Napapa, but Napapa is able to push his attacks away at the last moment. As Goku is pursuing Toppo, he comes face to face with Jiren until Universe 4's Nink (ニンク, Ninku) outflanks Goku by grappling and dragging him towards the edge of the stage with the intention of jumping off with him. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and knocks Nink off the stage. As Goku reverts back to his normal form to conserve energy, Basil, Lavender, Bergamo, and two other Universe 9 warriors surround him with 47 minutes remaining in the tournament. 98 22 "Oh, Uncertainty ! A Universe Despairs ! !" "Ā mujou ! Zetsubō suru Uchū ! !" (あぁ 無常 ! 絶望 する 宇宙 ! !) July 9, 2017 TBA Roh orders his warriors to attack Goku to avenge their defeat at the Zen Exhibition Match. Goku is forced to avoid fighting at his fullest in order to conserve stamina for later in the tournament. He fights Team Universe 9, where the Trio de Dangers brothers manage to overwhelm him thanks to their teamwork. Vegeta notices Goku's plight and reinforces him. Roh sends over three more fighters. Team Universe 9 is able to push Goku and Vegeta to the brink until Vegeta tricks Lavender and Hop (ソレル, Hoppu) into accidentally hitting each other. Goku and Vegeta take advantage of the confusion to defeat five of the Universe 9 warriors. No. 18 and Frieza each defeat Sorrel (ソレル, Soreru) and Roselle. Only Basil, Lavender, and Bergamo remain in the tournament for Team Universe 9. Goku and Vegeta push them to the edge of the stage. The brothers use a combination beam as a last ditch effort, but Goku and Vegeta power up to Super Saiyan Blue and knock them off the stage with a Final Kamehameha. With all 10 members defeated, Universe 9 is eliminated from the tournament. As a result, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erase Universe 9, Roh, Sidra, and all of their fighters. This amuses Universe 9's angel Mojito (モヒイト, Mohi'ito) and horrifies everyone else. 99 23 "Show Them ! Krillin's True Power ! !" "Misetsukero ! Kuririn no sokojikara ! !" (見せつけろ ! クリリン の 底力 ! !) July 16, 2017 TBA As the other warriors recover from the shock of Universe 9's erasure, No. 17 reminds No. 18 that they have infinite stamina due to their cyborg bodies and have no reason to hold back. Vegeta tries to fight Hit, but he is blocked by Botamo, who is immune to damage. Vegeta manages to pick Botamo up and nearly throws him off the stage, but Magetta stops him at the last moment. Meanwhile, Universe 10's Jium (ジウム, Jiumu) attacks Gohan and his friends. Jium is swiftly defeated by Master Roshi. Universe 4's Shosa (ショイサ, Shōsa) tricks No. 18 into lowering her guard by faking his own death and nearly knocks her off the stage with a barrage of ki blasts. Krillin rescues No. 18, and the two defeat Shosa with a powerful combination attack. They are challenged by Universe 4's Majora (マジョラ), who is a blind fighter that uses his powerful sense of smell to locate his enemies in battle. Although Majora proves to be stronger than Krillin, Krillin disables his nose by throwing his smelly shoe at him and knocks him off the stage. Krillin boasts about his victory, which allows Frost to knock him off with a single blow. Beerus and Shin berate Krillin for his carelessness with 43 minutes remaining in the tournament. 100 24 "Out Of Control ! The Savage Berserker Awakens ! !" "Daibōsō ! Mezame araburu Kyōsenshi ! !" (大 暴走 ! 目覚め 荒 ぶる 狂 戦士 ! !) July 23, 2017 TBA As Universe 7 recovers from Krillin's defeat, Cabba defeats Nigrisshi and Universe 10's Murisam (ムリサーム) and confronts Vegeta. Hit blows off Narirama's limbs and uses his time skip ability to dodge his ultimate attack. He flicks him off the stage. Meanwhile, Kale is disabled by Universe 10's Napapa and Methiop (メチオープ). They knock her unconscious and attempt to throw her off the stage, but Caulifla rescues her and defeats Napapa. The two confront Goku, and Caulifla knocks away Universe 2's Jimeze (ジーミズ, Jimizu) and demands to know how to become a Super Saiyan Blue. Goku refuses, and Caulifla transforms into an Ultra Super Saiyan. However, her increased muscle mass cripples her speed and allows Goku to counterattack. With Goku's aid, Caulifla manages to become a Super Saiyan 2, and the two resume their fight. As Kale watches them, she is once again consumed by her feelings of uselessness and transforms into her Berserker Super Saiyan form. Hit uses his time skip to save Caulifla from getting caught in the crossfire. Kale flies into a jealous rage and attacks Goku for allegedly stealing Caulifla from her. Kale easily overwhelms Goku and forces him to power up to Super Saiyan Blue. He unleashes a powerful Kamehameha, but Kale powers through it unharmed. As Piccolo realizes she has lost control of her power, Kale begins firing ki blasts at everything in sight and defeats Methiop. When Universe 11's Vuon (ブーオン, Būon) attempts to stop her, Kale defeats him as well. Jiren knocks her unconscious with a single ki blast. As Hit and Caulifla retreat with Kale, Goku challenges Jiren. 101 25 "The Impending Warriors of Justice ! The Pride Troopers ! !" "Semari kuru seigi no senshi ! Puraido Torūpāsu ! !" (迫り くる 正義 の 戦士 ! プライド ・ トルーパス ! !) July 30, 2017 TBA As Goku prepares to fight Jiren, Toppo suddenly ambushes him with a barrage of ki blasts. Toppo and Jiren decide to retreat and conserve their stamina. This leaves Goku to be dealt with by Kahseral and their fellow Pride Troopers Tupper (タッパー, Tappā), Zoiray (ゾイレー, Zoirē), Cocotte (ココット, Kokotto), and Kettol. The five declare their intent to defeat Caulifla and Kale to avenge Vuon's defeat. The two are forced to form a temporary alliance with Goku. Meanwhile, Master Roshi and Tien team up to defeat Universe 3's The Preecho (ザ ・ プリーチョ). They regroup with Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Frieza, where he has defeated Murichim. The Pride Troopers push Goku, Caulifla, and Kale to the brink, but No. 17 and No. 18 rescue them. No. 18 and Goku defeat Tupper, while No. 17 easily overpowers Kahseral. The remaining Pride Troopers regroup and focus their assault on the wounded Caulifla and Kale. Cocotte seals them in a separate dimension to ensure that Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 do not interfere. As the four beat Caulifla, Kale's self-hatred causes her to return to the Berserker Super Saiyan form, but she remains in control of herself this time. Caulifla and Kale use an extremely powerful combination ki blast to defeat Kahseral, Zoiray, and Kettol. Cocotte seals herself in a mini-dimension to avoid the blast, but No. 18 simply throws it off, eliminating Cocotte. Goku allows Caulifla and Kale to retreat so he can fight them at their full strength after they rest. The group is unaware that Brianne is observing them. 102 26 "The Power of Love Explodes ? ! Universe 2's Little Witch Warriors ! !" "Ai no chikara ga dai bakuhatsu ! ? dai ni uchu majo-kko senshi ! !" (愛 の 力 が 大 爆発 ! ? 第 2 宇宙 の 魔女 っ 子 戦士 ! !) August 6, 2017 TBA Brianne and her companions Sanka Ku (サンカ ・ クー, Sanka Kū) and Su Roas (スー ・ ロース, Sū Rōsu) announce themselves to the other fighters and begin to transform into their magical girl alter-egos. No. 17 blasts them before they can transform, but Brianne, Goku, and Toppo berate him for his dishonorable tactics and browbeat him into allowing them to transform, much to Beerus ' dismay. They assume their alter-egos Ribrianne, Kakunsa (カクンサ, Kakunsa), and Rozie (ロージィ, Rōjī) and barrage the arena with a powerful love-based attack that brainwashes some of the fighters. Universe 7's mental discipline allows them to overcome its effects. Gohan's group elects to split up and fight independently. Vegeta attacks Ribrianne, who counters with a rolling attack that knocks out Universe 10's Jirasen (ジラセン). Rozie attacks Goku with a flurry of blows that grows more powerful the longer she keeps it up, while Kakunsa battles No. 17 with her animalistic fighting style. No. 17 baits her into overextending herself and stuns her with a barrier. He attempts to knock her out of the stage, but her teammate Vikal (ビカル, Bikaru) rescues her. No. 17 decides to stop holding back and swiftly eliminates Vikal. He also eliminates Kakunsa with a powerful ki blast. Enraged by his actions, Ribrianne powers up and prepares to battle No. 17. 103 27 "Gohan, Show No Mercy ! Showdown With Universe 10 ! !" "Gohan yo hijōnare ! Dai ju uchu to no kessen ! !" (悟 飯 よ 非情 なれ ! 第 10 宇宙 と の 決戦 ! !) August 13, 2017 TBA Ribrianne and No. 17 fiercely attack each other, while Rozie begins to overwhelm Goku's defenses. She surrounds him with ki balls and attempts to blow him up, but No. 17 protects him with a barrier. Goku, who has studied Rozie's techniques, hits her with a powerful ki blast. As he and No. 17 corner Rozie and Ribrianne, Jimeze arrives and rescues them with instant transmission. Elsewhere, Botamo challenges Gohan on Champa's orders. As Piccolo and Goku observe, Gohan attacks with a flurry of blows, which apparently have no effect. However, Gohan's attacks begin to lift Botamo off the ground and renders him unable to defend himself, allowing Gohan to knock him off the stage. Universe 10's Obuni (オブニ) and Rubalt (ルバルト, Rubaruto) appear to challenge Gohan and Piccolo. Jimeze defeats Universe 10's Jilcol (ジルコル Jirukoru). With 8 warriors eliminated, Gowasu accepts his imminent demise, while Rumsshi remains defiant. Obuni shifts his ki away from his body to render himself impossible to detect and wounds Gohan. Rubalt initially has the upper hand against Piccolo, but Piccolo uses his Hellzone Grenade attack to knock out Rubalt, leaving Universe 10 with only Obuni. Obuni begins to overwhelm Gohan, which makes Gowasu want to cling to life again. Gohan powers up and powers through one of Obuni's punches. He counterattacks Obuni's moves by locating and hitting Obuni after he gets hit. Obuni pauses the fight to show his respect for Gohan, but refuses to lose for the sake of Universe 10. Gohan battles and defeats Obuni with a Kamehameha. All of Universe 10's fighters have been eliminated. Right before Universe 10 is annihilated, Gohan discovers a locket containing a picture of Obuni and his wife and child. Gohan and Universe 10's angel, Cus (クス, Kusu), mourn Universe 10's erasure. 104 28 "The Ultimate High Speed Battle Begins ! Goku and Hit Join Forces ! !" "Chōzetsu kōsoku batoru boppatsu ! Gokū to hitto no kyōdō sensen ! !" (超絶 光速 バトル 勃発 ! 悟空 と ヒット の 共同 戦線 ! !) August 20, 2017 TBA Dyspo challenges Hit and uses his incredible speed to overwhelm Hit's Time Skip. Everyone quickly deduces that Dyspo is listening for the sound of Hit's body tensing up to determine when he is about to attempt to use Time Skip. Hit resorts to fighting him conventionally, but he is pushed to the edge of the stage. Toppo deduces that Hit has adjusted to Dyspo's fighting style and is luring him into a trap. Toppo sends fellow pride trooper Kunshi (クンシー, Kunshī) to back him up. Before Dyspo can land the finishing blow, Hit suddenly turns intangible and sends Dyspo over the edge. However, Kunshi uses ropes made of his energy to pull Dyspo back onto the stage before he is eliminated. The two launch a renewed assault against Hit and drive him into a corner. Before they can finish him off, Goku interferes and rescues Hit. Goku uses his Super Saiyan God form to counter Dyspo's speed, while Hit uses his assassination technique to injure Kunshi. The two switch places. Hit uses a fake Time Skip to throw Dyspo off and wound him, while Goku overwhelms Kunshi with his Super Saiyan Blue form. Hit attempts to eliminate Dyspo, but Kunshi rescues him again. Kunshi charges Hit, who turns intangible and knocks him off the stage. Dyspo retreats and regroups with his allies. Toppo abandons all notions of justice and decides to focus on survival. Hit decides not to battle Goku as thanks for lending a hand. Goku and Hit vow to settle their score if they both make it to the end of the tournament. 105 29 "A Desperate Battle ! Master Roshi's Sacrifice ! !" "Funsen ! Mutenroshi inochi o Moyasu ! !" (奮戦 ! 武 天 老師 命 を 燃やす ! !) August 27, 2017 TBA Master Roshi quietly observes the battles from afar. He is challenged by an attractive warrior from Universe 4, Caway (キャウェイ, Kyauei), who attempts to seduce him. However, Caway's attempts to attack him brings him back to his senses. Roshi destroys her energy weapon, powers up, and drives her to jump off the stage. Roshi is next challenged by Dercori (ダーコリ, Dākori), who is a talisman-wielding warrior from Universe 4. She uses her talismans to confound Roshi with illusions and trap him in a single spot. Roshi uses the Evil Containment Wave to seal her in a small bottle and throw her off the arena. Quitela and Beerus get into an argument about the legality of the move, which is defused when Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō rule in Roshi's favor. Ganos, who is enraged at Roshi for eliminating his friends, challenges him and powers up into an avian form. Initially, Roshi is able to use his experience to predict, evade, and counter Ganos ' attacks. However, Ganos is able to grow more powerful the longer a fight drags on. He rallies and delivers a fierce series of blows to Roshi. Roshi attempts to hypnotize Ganos into falling asleep, but he attacks himself to wake himself up. Ganos demands that Roshi accept his limits and give up, but Roshi refuses. He unleashes a Max Power Kamehameha that defeats Ganos. However, the effort is too much for Roshi's body to handle, and he collapses. Goku races over to him and successfully defibrillates him with his ki. Goku escorts Roshi to safety. 106 30 "Find Him ! Death Match With An Invisible Attacker ! !" "Mikiwamero ! Sugata naki atakkā to no shitō ! !" (見極めろ ! 姿 なき アタッカー と の 死闘 ! !) September 3, 2017 TBA Goku brings Master Roshi to an isolated part of the stage and leaves him to rest at his request. Gohan and Piccolo are confronted by Universe 6's Dr. Rota (Dr. ロタ, Dokutā Rota), but Rota is shot down by a sniper before he can reveal his ability. Gohan and Piccolo are unable to find the location of the sniper until they find a red orb on the ground. It is revealed that the sniper, Universe 2's Prum (プラン, Puran), can see through these orbs. The lasers ricochet off of the orbs so that his true location is a secret. Piccolo tries to create a smokescreen in order to blur the vision, but Prum can still see them via their heat signatures. Prum shoots Piccolo and destroys both of his arms, which forces him to painfully regenerate them. Gohan and Piccolo realize that the orbs depend on heat signatures and blast the surrounding area to create multiple heat signatures. Prum responds by coming out of his hiding spot and blasting the entire area. Gohan and Piccolo are forced into hiding. Tien analyzes Dr. Rota and deduces that he was hit by a sniper as Goku and Vegeta arrive. Vegeta berates Tien, who warns them about Prum, but Vegeta arrogantly brushes it off until he is almost incapacitated by one of Prum's blasts. As Goku and Tien observe Prum, they deduce that there is another shooter from behind as Prum is merely reflecting the blasts. Vegeta and Goku go after Prum, while Tien goes to save Gohan and Piccolo. Goku and Vegeta try to attack Prum, but their ki blasts are reflected off of his body. Tien navigates through the field of blasts and confronts the true sniper, Prum's teammate Hermila (ハーミラ, Hāmira). Realizing that Prum can deflect ki blasts and not physical attacks, Vegeta and Goku throw giant boulders at him. Tien uses his Multi-form technique in order to buy himself time against Hermila, but three of his clones are shot down. The fourth and final Tien defeats Hermila. Just as Tien is about to eliminate him, Hermila shoots the ground underneath Tien's feet and knocks him off the stage. However, Tien's other three clones come back and drag Hermila down with them. Tien and Hermila are eliminated from the tournament. Although Beerus praises Tien for forcing the battle into a draw, Tien is noticeably upset about being defeated. As Prum is confronted by Vegeta, Dr. Rota comes back and attacks Prum as revenge for shooting him. Shortly after, Vegeta eliminates Prum and Dr. Rota from the tournament. 107 31 "Revenge "F" The Cunning Trap ? !" "Fukushū no Efu ! Shikakerareta Kōkatsu na Wana ! ?" (復讐 の 「 F 」 ! しかけ られ た 狡猾 な 罠 ! ?) September 17, 2017 TBA Frost recalls how Champa promised to pardon his crimes if he humiliated and defeated Universe 7. Elsewhere, Universe 3's Maji Kayo confronts Universe 11's remaining warriors. He entraps Dyspo with his liquid body, but Jiren effortlessly defeats him with a single blow. As Master Roshi attempts to recover from his previous fights, Frost corners and attacks him. Goku sees this and tries to rush to his aid, but he is confronted by Ribrianne. Roshi hits Frost with a flurry of blows and attempts to use the Evil Containment Wave, but the strain proves too much for him. He flubs the attack. Frost barrages Roshi with ki blasts and sends an attack towards Vegeta, which provokes him. Vegeta interferes before Frost can finish Roshi. Magetta arrives to reinforce Frost, and the two battle Vegeta. Frost goads Roshi into using the Evil Containment Wave on Magetta despite the risk of killing himself. When Roshi falls for it, Frost reflects the attack and seals Vegeta into a bottle. With the last of his strength, Roshi uses a small ki blast to destroy the bottle and free Vegeta. Vegeta immediately turns Super Saiyan Blue, and Frost flees. Vegeta knocks Magetta off the stage and tells Roshi to drop out so he can receive medical attention. Roshi jumps off the stage, and he is given a Senzu Bean. Beerus admits that Roshi has earned his respect. 108 32 "Frieza and Frost ! Conjoined Malice ? !" "Furīza to Furosuto ! Majiwaru Akui ! ?" (フリーザ と フロスト ! 交わる 悪意 ! ?) September 24, 2017 TBA As Goku battles Ribrianne, the gods of the top four universes speculate on who will win the tournament. Meanwhile, Gohan is confronted by Jimeze. Jimeze makes use of his Instant Transmission technique to confound and damage Gohan. As he prepares to finish him, Frieza intervenes. When Frieza does not immediately attack Jimeze, Universe 7's spectators speculate he may intend to betray and defeat Gohan so he can seize the wish on the Super Dragon Balls for himself. Frieza steps aside and allows Jimeze to continue his fight with Gohan. Jimeze corners Gohan again and attempts to finish him, but Frieza destroys his attack with a ki blast. Enraged, Jimeze attacks Frieza, who swiftly tortures and eliminates him. Frost appears and declares his intention to defeat Gohan, and Frieza admits that the two intend to work together in order to exact revenge on the Saiyans. Frieza battles Gohan, who counterattacks. Frieza uses his Golden form to knock out Gohan. However, instead of eliminating him, he double-crosses and eliminates Frost. Gohan admits that he immediately figured out Frieza's plan and played along with him. An enraged Frost attempts to attack Frieza from the spectator stands, but Grand Zenō erases him, explaining that this is forbidden and Universe 6 would be erased upon a second offence. Meanwhile, Goku continues to battle Ribrianne. 109 33 "The Ultimate Enemy Approaches Goku ! Now, Let Loose ! The Killer Spirit Bomb ! !" "Goku ni Semaru Saikyo no Teki ! Ima Koso Hanate ! Hisassu no Genki-Dama ! !" (悟空 に 迫る 最強 の 敵 ! 今 こそ 放 て ! 必殺 の 元気 玉 ! !) October 8, 2017 TBA Ribrianne declares her intention to use the wish to become a love goddess adored by all beings using the Super Dragon Balls. Goku considers using the wish to benefit his family or meet a strong opponent. Ribrianne absorbs the love of her teammates and becomes Super Ribrianne. She attacks Goku with several ki blasts, and he counters by turning Super Saiyan Blue and knocking her away. Ribrianne lands near Jiren, and Goku sees him and prepares to finally battle him. Universe 11's God of Destruction, Belmod, telepathically orders Jiren to defeat Goku. Belmod hopes to demoralize the other universes by defeating the strongest fighter besides Jiren himself. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20, but that proves to be no match for Jiren's overwhelming power. Goku begins powering up a Spirit Bomb, and all of his teammates except Vegeta lend him their energy. Despite the time it takes to charge the attack, Jiren agrees to wait for him to complete it. Ribrianne attempts to attack Goku from behind, but she is stopped by Vegeta. Goku completes the Spirit Bomb and throws it, but Jiren deflects it. The two engage in a struggle to take control of the Spirit Bomb. This forces Goku to use Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 to keep up. However, Jiren prevails and begins to overwhelm Goku with his own attack. 110 34 "Son Goku Wakes ! New Level of the Awakened ! !" "Son Gokū kakusei ! Mezameshi mono no aratanaru gokui ! !" (孫悟空 覚醒 ! 目覚め し 者 の 新た なる 極意 ! !) October 8, 2017 TBA Goku powers up himself and pushes the Spirit Bomb back towards Jiren, which locks him in a stalemate. Whis realizes that Jiren is at least as powerful as a God of Destruction. As the two struggle to overpower each other, the Spirit Bomb suddenly condenses into a small black hole, which absorbs Goku and causes him to vanish. The Grand Minister rules that since Goku's own attack apparently vaporized him, Jiren will not be disqualified for destroying him. As Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō prepare to eliminate Goku, he suddenly reappears and reaches a new level of power. Goku resumes the fight, and he is able to go toe-to-toe with Jiren. Whis theorizes Goku must have absorbed the Spirit Bomb and unlocked an ability called Ultra Instinct (身勝手 の 極意" 兆", Migatte no Gokui). Goku uses another powerful attack in an attempt to eliminate Jiren, but he fails, and exhausts his newfound power. Jiren knocks him away, and Hit attempts to take advantage of the opportunity and attacks Jiren. Vegeta demands to know what happened to Goku before preparing to fight Ribrianne, while Frieza appears to corner Goku and aims an attack at him. 111 35 "The Surreal Supreme Battle ! Hit vs Jiren ! !" "I jigen no kyokuchi batoru ! Hitto basasu Jiren ! !" (異 次元 の 極致 バトル ! ヒット VS ジレン ! !) October 15, 2017 TBA Instead of killing the defenseless Goku, Frieza shares with him some of his energy and repays his act of mercy during their fight on Planet Namek. Meanwhile, Hit uses his time-skip powers against Jiren, but his attacks fail to connect. Goku spectates the battle, but he is ambushed by Saonel (サオネル, Saoneru) and Pirina (ピリナ, Pirina), Namekians from Universe 6, who are confronted by Gohan and Piccolo. Elsewhere, Vegeta fights Ribrianne, and he is easily overpowering her in his base form until Rozie interferes and retreats with Ribrianne. Ribrianne loses hope due to the gap in power, but Rozie motivates her. Meanwhile, Hit keeps attacking Jiren to no avail, but he is able to react and block most of Jiren's punches. After being knocked back, Hit sneaks up behind Jiren and lands a strong punch on his heart. He knocks Jiren to the edge of the ring after a brief struggle. Hit uses his own time-skip powers continually on Jiren to stop his movement. Realizing that he can not hold Jiren for long, Hit urges Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale to keep fighting for Universe 6. Hit pools all his energy in a final attack to defeat him, but Jiren stops Hit's attack only with his glare. Jiren breaks free and eliminates Hit. As the Tournament of Power reaches its midway point, Jiren begins to meditate. He is certain that there are no other warriors strong enough to fight him. Jiren leaves the fight to Toppo and Dyspo. Viara (ビアラ, Biara) and Katopesla (カトペスラ, Katopesura) of Universe 3 attempt to attack him while meditating, but Jiren's energy alone is enough to push them back. 112 36 "A Saiyan's Vow ! Vegeta's Resolution ! !" "Saiya-jin no chikai ! Bejīta no kakugo ! !" (サイヤ 人 の 誓い ! ベジータ の 覚悟 ! !) October 22, 2017 TBA Despite his exhaustion and low energy, Goku is determined to keep fighting. However, he is suddenly targeted by Koitsukai (コイツカイ, Koitukai), Panchia (パンチア, Panchia), and Bollarator (ボラレータ, Borarēta) of Universe 3. Gohan and Piccolo want to help him, but they are distracted by their own battle with Saonel and Pilina. Caulifla and Kale are discussing the battle between Goku and Jiren, when they are confronted by Monna (モンナ, Monna), a female warrior from Universe 4. Caulifla faces off against Monna, but Cabba appears and takes her place. He instructs Caulifla and Kale to retreat for now. Cabba turns Super Saiyan and battles Monna, but he is initially overpowered. Monna almost knocks Cabba off the stage, but Vegeta intervenes and catches him before he can fall. Vegeta and Cabba both promise that, if either of them wins the tournament, the winner will use the Super Dragon Balls to restore the other's erased universe and its inhabitants. Newly inspired, Cabba fights Monna again, but he is losing until he taps into his anger and unlocks Super Saiyan 2. With his new power, Cabba easily defeats and eliminates Monna. However, Frieza appears, fights Cabba, and easily eliminates him as well. Frieza reveals that he plans to win the tournament in order to use the Super Dragon Balls to control the gods. Meanwhile, Vegeta decides to challenge Jiren, but he is intercepted by Toppo. The two battle each other. Vegeta ends up meeting up with Goku, who is still having difficulty with his three opponents. However, Caulifla intervenes and knocks Koitsukai, Borareta, and Pancea away before powering up to Super Saiyan 2 and challenging Goku herself. 113 37 "With Great Joy ! The Repeat Battle-Crazy Saiyan Fight ! !" "Kiki to Shite ! Sentō-kyō Saiya-jin Batoru Futatabi ! !" (嬉々 として ! 戦闘 狂 サイヤ 人 バトル 再び ! !) October 29, 2017 TBA Caulifla demands that Goku fight her and teach her how to unlock Super Saiyan 3 so that she can become strong enough to win the tournament. She begins fighting Goku, who does not initially power up beyond his base form. However, Goku's superior martial arts skills allow him to keep up with her even in her Super Saiyan 2 form. Eventually, she is able to adapt to his moves, which forces Goku to power up to Super Saiyan 2 himself. The two of them fight evenly for some time. Goku later calls in Kale to join the battle. His superior power and skill enables him to fight them both at once, but they are able to match him by working together. They land a massive combined attack on him, but Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 3 and easily deflects their attacks. However, Goku lacks the stamina to maintain that form and reverts to Super Saiyan 2. Kale's desire to become stronger inadvertently causes her to transform into her Berserker Super Saiyan form again. 114 38 "Intimidating Passion ! The Birth of a New Super Warrior ! !" "Kiki semaru ! Aratana chō sen-shi no bakutan ! !" (鬼気 せまる ! 新た な 超 戦士 の 爆誕 ! !) November 5, 2017 TBA Vegeta continues his battle with Toppo, while Caulifla is able to help Kale regain control of her Berserker form. Caulifla and Kale battle Goku together and are able to hold him off. Meanwhile, Frieza is confronted by Katopesla, but they are interrupted by Goku's battle with Caulifla and Kale. Frieza wants to fight Caulifla and Kale, but Goku insists that he will fight them himself. Frieza backs down and watches the fight. The three Saiyans resume their battle. After unsuccessfully attempting to use Instant Transmission as a strategy, Goku powers up to his Super Saiyan God form and easily overpowers the two of them. As Goku prepares to eliminate Caulifla and Kale with a powerful Kamehameha, it is revealed that the girls were given a pair of Potara earrings by Fuwa, Universe 6's Supreme Kai. They use the earrings and fuse to become a single being with immense power, who takes the name Kefla (ケフラ, Kefura). 115 39 "Goku VS Kefla ! Super Saiyan Blue Defeated ? !" "Gokū vāsasu Kefura ! Sūpāsaiya-jin Burū Yabureru ! ?" (悟空 VS ケフラ ! 超 サイヤ 人 ブルー 敗れる ! ?) November 12, 2017 TBA As Vegeta continues to fight Toppo, Gohan and Piccolo are engaged with Saonel and Pirina. No. 18 is attacked by Katopesla, but she is saved by No. 17. Meanwhile, Goku continues his fight with Kefla. The Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō approve Kefla's use of the Potara earrings. The other universes consider giving the Potara to their warriors as well. Pell (ペル, Peru), the Supreme Kai of Universe 2, gives his Potara to Rabanra (ラバンラ, Rabanra) and Zarbuto (ザーブト, Zābuto), but the earrings are destroyed by Kefla charging through them to continue fighting Goku. The battle becomes intense with Kefla gaining the upper hand. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue, but Kefla counters by powering up to Super Saiyan. However, Goku uses the Kaioken and regains the advantage. He appears to be winning, but Kefla lands a sneak attack that knocks him out of Super Saiyan Blue. She prepares to eliminate him, but Goku unexpectedly reawakens Ultra Instinct again and easily dodges her attacks. 116 40 "The Sign of a Comeback ! Ultra Instinct's Huge Explosion ! !" "Gyakuten no kizashi ! Migatte no gokui ga dai bakuhatsu ! !" (逆転 の 兆し ! 身勝手 の 極意 が 大 爆発 ! !) November 19, 2017 TBA To counter Goku's increase in power, Kefla powers up to Super Saiyan 2, and the two of them face off. Goku still easily dodges Kefla's attacks, but his own attacks are not strong enough to take her down. Whis explains that when Goku launches his attacks, it interferes with his concentration and prevents him from using Ultra Instinct to its full potential. Jiren senses the energy from the battle, which prompts him to awaken from his meditation and rejoin Toppo and Dyspo. Vegeta realizes that Ultra Instinct is the level of skill that Whis was training him and Goku to attain, and decides that he must reach it too. Goku begins running low on stamina, so he declares that he will end the fight with his next attack. Kefla panics and unleashes a multitude of deadly energy beams. Her ultimate attack devastates the ring, but Goku easily dodges her blasts while charging a Kamehameha. Goku jumps into the air, so Kefla focuses all of her power into a single blast and launches it at him, taking advantage of his apparent inability to dodge. However, he backflips and uses the charged-up energy to slide over her attack, and launches his Kamehameha at point-blank range, blasting Kefla out of the ring and eliminating her. Her Potara earrings shatter, and she splits back into Kale and Caulifla. With both of them eliminated, Saonel and Pirina are the only remaining warriors from Team Universe 6. NOTE: This episode was dedicated in memory of Hiromi Tsuru, who passed away on November 16, 2017. 117 41 "Showdown of Love ! Androids VS Universe 2 ! !" "Ai no daikessen ! Jinzōningen VS Dai ni uchū ! !" (愛 の 大 決戦 ! 人造 人間 VS 第 2 宇宙 ! !) November 26, 2017 TBA Goku is left exhausted from his battle with Kefla. He is confronted by all five remaining warriors from Universe 2. Gohan and Piccolo try to help him, but they are intercepted by Saonel and Pirina. Elsewhere, Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and tries to unlock Ultra Instinct against him. However, he is unsuccessful, and resorts to his normal fighting style. Vegeta easily overpowers Katopesla. Rozie and Ribrianne launch a combined attack at Goku, but No. 17 and No. 18 arrive in time to deflect it. The androids battle Rozie and Ribrianne. No. 17 defeats and eliminates Rozie, while No. 18 knocks Ribrianne out of her powered-up transformation. This causes her to revert into Brianne. Brianne is able to catch No. 18 in an energy trap, while her comrades from Universe 2 send their love to her. This allows Brianne to transform into a giant manifestation of her Super Ribrianne form. No. 18 almost gives up until her love for Krillin and Marron gives her the determination to break free of Ribrianne's trap. With No. 17's help, No. 18 blasts through Ribrianne's giant form and eliminates her. Brianne realizes that she lost because of No. 18's strong love for Krillin, while Goku faces off against Zirloin (ザーロイン, Zāroin), Zarbuto, and Rabanra of Universe 2. 118 42 "Accelerated Tragedy Vanishing Universes." "Kasokusuru Higeki Kieyuku Uchū." (加速 する 悲劇 消え ゆく 宇宙.) December 3, 2017 TBA Goku battles against Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra from Universe 2, while Gohan and Piccolo are fighting against Saonel and Pirina. Saonel and Pirina's power suddenly increases, and it is revealed that they had each fused with many Namekians from their universe before coming to the tournament, which greatly increased their own powers. No. 17 and No. 18 join Goku to help in the battle against the remaining Universe 2 warriors. It is revealed that Universe 2's angel, Sour (サワア, Sawaa), has been broadcasting the tournament to the populace of their universe. Universe 2's inhabitants channel their love to Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, who are able to transform into forms similar to Ribrianne, Rozie, and Kakunsa's transformed states. Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 battle Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo continue fighting Saonel and Pirina. The Universe 2 trio unleash a legendary Universe 2 technique, the Pretty Black Hole, which traps and threatens to sink Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 through the fighting stage. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue and breaks through the Pretty Black Hole with a Kamehameha that eliminates Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo blast Saonel and Pirina off the ring with a powerful combined attack that eliminates them as well. With all of their fighters eliminated, both Universe 2 and Universe 6 are erased. Brianne leads the Universe 2 team in a final happy moment before their erasure, while Cabba wishes Vegeta good luck. Champa taunts Beerus before being erased. Beerus remains impassive in the face of his brother's erasure. Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and warns him that he is in a bad mood. 119 43 "Unavoidable ? ! The Fierce Stealth Attack ! !" "Kaihi funō ! ? Suterusu kōgeki no mōi ! !" (回避 不能 ! ? ステルス 攻撃 の 猛威 ! !) December 10, 2017 TBA Vegeta overpowers Katopesla and drives him to the edge of the ring. Katopesla is able to catch himself, but he is pushed over the edge and eliminated by an unseen force. Vegeta and Gohan are attacked by the same force, but Vegeta is able to stop himself from going over the edge, while Piccolo catches Gohan. No. 18 is attacked by the invisible fighter, who is revealed to be one of the missing Universe 4 fighters, Gamisaras (ガミサラス, Gamisarasu). Gohan creates a cloud of dust that coats Gamisaras, which allows Piccolo to see him. Piccolo easily eliminates Gamisaras. Undaunted, Quitela orders the remaining Universe 4 fighters to step up their game. Shantza (シャンツァ, Shantsa) generates a dome that envelops the Universe 7 team and manifests illusions of the defeated fighters from the erased universes. However, Piccolo spots Shantza and blasts him off the ring, which eliminates him and destroys the illusions. Universe 4's last fighter, Damon (ダモン, Damon), is also assumed to be invisible since no one can see him. Piccolo is able to sense Damon's attacks, but he proves unable to hit Damon, who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him. No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug-like creature rather than an invisible person, which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him. To solve this problem, Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air, which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts. No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him. With all of their fighters eliminated, Universe 4 is promptly erased. 120 44 "The Perfect Survival Tactic ! Universe 3's Menacing Assassin ! !" "Kanpeki na Seizon Senryaku ! Dai san Uchū Kyōi no Shikaku ! !" (完璧 なる 生存 戦略 ! 第 3 宇宙 脅威 の 刺客 ! !) December 17, 2017 TBA Following the elimination of Universe 4, the remaining fighters from Universe 3 take the offensive against Universe 7. While Viara is defeated and eliminated by No. 17 and No. 18's combined efforts, Paparoni (パパロニ, Paparoni) sends Panchia, Koitsukai, and Bollarator to attack Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta. To help Goku and Vegeta save their energy to confront Universe 11, Gohan decides to face the three robots alone. He gains the upper hand until Paparoni has them combine together into a much stronger robot called Koichiarator (コイチアレータ, Koichiarēta). Koichiarator overpowers Gohan until Goku and Vegeta step in. The two distract the enemy, while Gohan charges and strikes with an attack powerful enough to defeat it. With his robots defeated, Paparoni refuses to surrender and declares that he will unleash his trump card on Universe 7. 121 45 "All-Out War ! The Ultimate Quadruple Merge vs Universe 7's Full-Scale Attack ! !" "Sōryokusen ! Kyūkoku no Yontai Gattai VS Dai nana Uchū Sōkōgeki ! !" (総力 戦 ! 究極 の 4 体 合体 VS 第 7 宇宙 総 攻撃 ! !) December 24, 2017 TBA Paparoni and Koichiarator merge to form Anilaza (アニラーザ, Anirāza), the most powerful warrior from Universe 3. Anilaza begins to overwhelm the Saiyans, which forces No. 17 and No. 18 to reinforce them. The five attempt to coordinate their attacks to catch Anilaza off-guard, but he deflects them all. It is revealed that Anilaza can use echolocation to detect his opponents ' movements. Anilaza begins teleporting his punches, and he nearly knocks Goku off the stage until Frieza steps in and knocks him back onto the fighting stage. Realizing that the Universe 7 warriors will rescue each other from defeat, Anilaza attempts to eat No. 18, who is rescued by Goku. Anilaza corners No. 17 and overwhelms him. He knocks him off the fighting stage, but No. 18 sacrifices herself to kick No. 17 back onto the fighting stage. She is eliminated from the tournament. With no other options, the Universe 7 warriors power up to their maximum levels and engage in a ki clash with Anilaza. They buy time for No. 17 to pierce through Anilaza's attack and damage his energy reactor. This enables the others to overwhelm and eliminate Anilaza. With all of their warriors eliminated, Universe 3 is erased. As the Universe 7 warriors begin to celebrate, the remaining Universe 11 warriors step forward to challenge them. 122 46 "For One's Own Pride ! Vegeta's Challenge to Be The Strongest ! !" "Onore no Hokori wo Kakete ! Bejīta Saikyō he no Chōsen ! !" (己 の 誇り を かけ て ! ベジータ 最強 へ の 挑戦 ! !) January 7, 2018 TBA With only two universes remaining, the Grand Minister compresses the bleachers so that the remaining spectators are all close together. The final warriors begin their battle: Gohan and No. 17 battle Toppo, Frieza fights Dyspo, and Goku and Vegeta battle Jiren. Jiren overwhelms Goku with a flurry of punches, but Vegeta is able to analyze Jiren's attack patterns and dodges his attacks. He lands a solid blow to Jiren's midsection, but Jiren counters with a powerful blast that nearly rings Vegeta out. Meanwhile, Frieza blocks one of Dyspo's attacks with his tail, but Dyspo uses it as leverage to injure him. Jiren disparages Vegeta for his self-righteousness, but Vegeta declares that it is the source of his strength. He powers up a Final Flash and goads Jiren into taking it head-on. However, the attack fails to damage Jiren, who acknowledges the power of Vegeta's attack before incapacitating him. 123 47 "Body and Soul, Full Power Release ! Goku and Vegeta ! !" "Zenshin Zenrei Zenryoku Kaihō ! Gokū to Bejīta ! !" (全身 全霊 全力 解放 ! 悟空 と ベジータ ! !) January 14, 2018 TBA With Vegeta down, Goku faces off against Jiren. Meanwhile, the other battles continue. Frieza decides to start fighting Dyspo seriously, while Gohan and No. 17 are outmatched against Toppo. Outmatched in power, Goku instead uses ki blasts to create a minefield around Jiren, but it has no effect. Goku then lures Jiren onto a large rock that extends out over the edge of the fighting stage and cuts through the rock with a Destructo Disc. This causes Jiren to fall, but Jiren is able to push off the falling debris and jumps back onto the fighting stage. Angered by his near-elimination, Jiren finally shows his real power and easily overwhelms Goku with a volley of punches. Goku and Vegeta both get back up and power up to Super Saiyan Blue. Goku uses his maximum Kaioken beyond his previous limitations, while Vegeta is able to surpass his limits by tapping into more ki in his body, and attains a transformation similar to the Ascended Super Saiyan form, the Super Saiyan Blue Evolution form. Fully powered up, Goku and Vegeta attack Jiren as a team, and they are able to catch him off guard with their un-coordinated attacks. 124 48 "The Fiercely Overwhelming Assault ! Gohan's Last Stand ! !" "Shippū-Dotō no Mōshū ! Gohan Haisui no Jin ! !" (疾風 怒涛 の 猛襲 ! 悟 飯 背水 の 陣 ! !) January 21, 2018 TBA As Goku and Vegeta continue their battle with Jiren, the battle between Dyspo and Frieza intensifies. The two seem evenly matched, until Frieza breaks off the fight and offers to help Universe 11 win the tournament if they promise to resurrect him with the Super Dragon Balls. Dyspo refuses the offer, so Frieza powers up to his Golden form and gains the advantage in the fight. Dyspo reveals his own ultimate technique, the Super Maximum Light Speed Mode, which increases his power and speed even further, and overwhelms Frieza. Gohan and No. 17 realize that Frieza is in danger of being knocked off the fighting stage, so No. 17 distracts Toppo, while Gohan goes to Frieza's aid. Gohan and Frieza take on Dyspo as a team, but they have little success. Gohan develops a strategy that has Frieza use his energy to form a cage around Dyspo, which prevents him from using his high-speed attacks and allows Gohan to gain the upper hand. Unfortunately, Frieza runs out of energy, and the cage dissolves before Gohan can land the finishing blow. However, Gohan is able to grab Dyspo and hold him in place, while Frieza launches a blast that knocks them off the fighting stage and eliminates them both from the tournament. 125 49 "With Imposing Presence ! God of Destruction Toppo Descends ! !" "Ifu-Dōdō ! Hakaishin Toppo Kōrin !" (威風 堂々 ! 破壊 神 トッポ 降臨 ! !) January 28, 2018 TBA Goku and Vegeta continue their battle with Jiren, while No. 17 and Toppo fight. No. 17 and Toppo engage in a beam clash, which Toppo is winning. Frieza intervenes and strikes Toppo repeatedly from behind, which allows No. 17 to overpower Toppo's blast. In the wake of the explosion, Toppo appears to have been defeated. However, he gets back up and powers up, using the same type of energy as a God of Destruction. Belmod explains that Toppo is a candidate to be Universe 11's next God of Destruction, which is why he can wield the same kind of power. Toppo unleashes his new power, which damages the fighting stage and breaks a large portion of it. No. 17 and Frieza attack Toppo repeatedly, but his power is now far superior to theirs. Toppo easily defeats them both. Fortunately, they are able to stay on the fighting stage, but Toppo knocks Frieza unconscious and engages in another beam clash with No. 17. 126 50 "Surpass Even a God ! Vegeta's Desperate Blow ! !" "Kami wo mo Koero ! Bejīta Sutemi no Ichigeki ! !" (神 を も 超えろ ! ベジータ 捨て身 の 一撃 ! !) February 4, 2018 TBA Toppo easily overpowers No. 17's blast. No. 17 is able to evade him for a while by using the broken fighting stage to his advantage, but Toppo effortlessly withstands No. 17's attacks. Toppo prepares to eliminate No. 17 with a giant energy blast. Frieza rejoins the battle and deflects Toppo's attack. Frieza uses his own energy attack to immobilize Toppo, which allows him and No. 17 to land numerous attacks, but none of them have any effect. Toppo is about to eliminate them both, when he is interrupted by Goku and Vegeta, who are still fighting Jiren. Frieza and No. 17 are hit by one of Jiren's attacks, which gives Toppo the opportunity to attack Vegeta instead. Toppo overwhelms Vegeta with his new power and states that he has cast aside everything else in order to become strong enough to win the tournament. However, Vegeta is inspired by his family, his promise to Cabba, and his Saiyan pride. He refuses to cast anything aside. Vegeta unleashes his full power and overwhelms Toppo. Vegeta and Toppo both use their ultimate attacks: Toppo unleashes his Energy of Destruction, while Vegeta uses the Final Explosion technique that he used against Majin Buu. Vegeta's attack overwhelms Toppo's attack, blasts Toppo out of the fighting stage, and eliminates him from the tournament. This also causes even more damage to the fighting stage. Due to Vegeta being much stronger than the last time he used the Final Explosion technique, he survives the blast, but his energy is almost completely drained. No. 17 also reappears, but he has been injured by Jiren's attack. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all face off against Jiren, who begins to unleash his full power. 127 51 "The Approaching Wall ! The Final Barrier of Hope ! !" "Semari-kuru Shōheki ! Kibō wo Takushita Saigo no Baria ! !" (迫り くる 障壁 ! 希望 を 託 した 最後 の バリア ! !) February 11, 2018 TBA Jiren powers up to his maximum. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all attack him simultaneously, but he easily overpowers them. However, No. 17 manages to land a sneak attack and injures Jiren. Jiren defeats Goku and Vegeta, while Frieza rejoins the fight and tries to kill Jiren in his golden form. However, Frieza is easily defeated as well. No. 17 asks Jiren what his wish on the Super Dragon Balls would be, and Belmod explains that Jiren's endless pursuit of strength was inspired when his parents, most of his comrades, and mentor were killed by a powerful villain. However, his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship, and he now focuses solely on increasing his own strength. No. 17 admires Jiren's human qualities, but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe's team for his own ends. Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17, Goku, and Vegeta. No. 17 uses a barrier to hold back Jiren's blast and forms force fields around Goku and Vegeta to protect them, before self-destructing to destroy Jiren's blast. Despite his exhausted state, Vegeta faces off against Jiren and declares that he will defeat him. 128 52 "Noble Pride to the End ! Vegeta Falls ! !" "Kedakai Hokori Saigo Made ! Bejīta Chiru ! !" (気高い 誇り 最後 まで ! ベジータ 散る ! !) February 18, 2018 TBA Vegeta prepares for a final stand against Jiren. Although Vegeta is too exhausted to turn into even a Super Saiyan, he still decides to take on Jiren. Jiren easily dodges his attacks and continues to pummel Vegeta. Jiren injures Vegeta's left eye in the process. Vegeta is knocked to the brink of elimination, and he begins to think about the people in his life he cares about the most. He gets back up and continues to fight Jiren, who is impressed by Vegeta's pride. Vegeta nearly rings out again. His boot catches onto a floating piece of rubble, which narrowly allows him to stay in the fight because the pieces of rubble still count as part of the fighting stage. Vegeta hears Bulma's voice urging him to fight on, and he returns to fight Jiren once again. Jiren is unable to understand why Vegeta continues to fight him. Vegeta fires off a Final Flash, but Jiren is unfazed. Jiren knocks Vegeta out of the fighting stage and eliminates him from the tournament. Although Vegeta is upset at being unable to last until the end, he gives Goku his remaining energy at the last second before falling out of bounds. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and begins to fight Jiren with his remaining power. Even with Vegeta's energy, Goku is still overwhelmed by Jiren. He is knocked back into his base form. When Goku is pushed back to the edge of the fighting stage and only one punch away from defeat, Vegeta shouts at Goku. Goku thinks about how the others have all put their faith in him. As Jiren delivers the final blow, Goku suddenly reactivates Ultra Instinct and dodges the attack. With his new power, Goku is able to effortlessly dodge Jiren's attacks and lands a heavy blow on him. Both fighters face off and prepare for their final battle. 129 53 "Limits Super Surpassed ! Ultra Instinct Mastered ! !" "Genkai Chōzetsu Toppa ! Migatte no Gokui Kiwamaru ! !" (限界 超絶 突破 ! 身勝手 の 極意 極まる ! !) March 4, 2018 TBA Whis points out that, since Goku has no allies to help him and no time to recover from the strain caused by Ultra Instinct, this will be his last chance to end the battle. Goku and Jiren resume their battle, but Goku has the same problem he experienced with Kefla, and is unable to attack at his full potential. Goku tries the same trick he used on Kefla by powering up a Kamehameha and firing it at Jiren, but Jiren is able to punch through the blast. Belmod is confident that Goku's incomplete Ultra Instinct will not be enough to win, but Vegeta points out that, throughout the tournament, all of the Saiyans have been able to surpass their limits and achieve higher levels of power. Jiren is able to trap Goku on a single floating rock and fires a barrage of attacks down at him in an attempt to knock him out, but Goku begins blocking Jiren's attacks with his own punches. Jiren launches a final blast down at Goku, but Goku suddenly powers up immensely. He easily blocks Jiren's blast and jumps back up to the fighting stage. Jiren attacks again, but this time Goku easily overpowers him with a flurry of punches. Whis reveals that Goku has completed his ascension. Goku's hair and eyes have turned silver, and he now has full mastery over Ultra Instinct. 130 54 "The Greatest Showdown of All Time ! The Ultimate Survival Battle ! !" "Kūzenzetsugo no Chō Kessen ! Kyūkyoku no Sabaibaru Batoru ! !" (空前 絶後 の 超 決戦 ! 究極 の サバイバル バトル ! !) March 18, 2018 TBA Having mastered Ultra Instinct, Goku overpowers and corners Jiren, which forces Jiren to break through his own limits and power up even further. The two exchange attacks continuously. Despite almost being defeated twice, Goku stands up and recovers. When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept it, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers that is repelled by a furious Goku, who finally defeats him. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Ultra Instinct for too long. Jiren takes the opportunity to knock Goku off the fighting stage, but Goku is saved by Frieza. No. 17 is also revealed to have survived Jiren's blast. As Frieza and No. 17 prepare themselves to face Jiren, Goku writhes in pain. 131 55 "The Miraculous Conclusion ! Farewell, Goku ! Until We Meet Again !" "Kiseki no ketchaku ! Saraba Goku ! Mataauhimade ! !" (奇跡 の 決着 ! さらば 悟空 ! また 会う 日 まで ! !) March 25, 2018 TBA With Goku down, Frieza and No. 17 face off against Jiren. No. 17 manages to injure Jiren, who collapses from exhaustion. Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Toppo calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up and fires a massive blast at Frieza and No. 17. They form a barrier to shield themselves, but Frieza is running low on energy and loses his Golden form. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier and enables them to block Jiren's blast. Goku and Frieza take on Jiren together, while No. 17 provides cover fire. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him out of the ring. All three of them are eliminated from the tournament. With all of their fighters gone, Universe 11 is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the fighting stage, No. 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power, and he is given the privilege of getting his wish granted from the Super Dragon Balls. After some consideration, No. 17 wishes to restore all of the universes that had been erased, which brings all their inhabitants back to life. As the erased universes are restored, the Grand Minister reveals that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had foresaw the outcome of a virtuous being winning the Tournament of Power who would make a selfless wish on the Super Dragon Balls. He also stated that they would have otherwise erased the entire multiverse if the winner had wished for selfish reasons, as this would have shown that the winning universe was no better than the erased universes and that the universes excluded from the tournament were not equally worthy of existing. As a reward for doing well in the tournament, Whis restores Frieza to life. In Universe 11, Jiren establishes a real friendship with Toppo and looks forward to having a rematch with Goku someday. The group from Universe 7 return home. Frieza leaves Earth and resumes leadership of his empire. Goku vows to defeat him if he starts causing trouble again. Goku and Vegeta meet for a sparring match in the place where they first fought. Goku reveals that he can not use Ultra Instinct anymore and believes that he obtained it by accident during the tournament. Goku and Vegeta declare that they will keep finding new levels of strength. They race towards each other to fight.

Prompt: Originally described as the chief of evil spirits in Vedic-era texts, Kubera acquired the status of a Deva (god) only in the Purana s and the Hindu epics. The scriptures describe that Kubera once ruled Lanka, but was overthrown by his demon half-brother Ravana, later settling in the city of Alaka in the Himalayas. Descriptions of the "glory" and "splendours" of Kubera's city are found in many scriptures.<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Ground truth: Originally described as the chief of evil spirits in Vedic-era texts, Kubera acquired the status of a Deva (god) only in the Purana s and the Hindu epics. The scriptures describe that Kubera once ruled Lanka, but was overthrown by his demon half-brother Ravana, later settling in the city of Alaka in the Himalayas. Descriptions of the "glory" and "splendours" of Kubera's city are found in many scriptures.
[0.582, 0.000]Original response: In Hindu mythology, Kubera and Ravana were once half-brothers.
[0.628, 0.078]Prifix response: Originally described as the ruler of Lanka described in the Ramayana, Ravana was a demon king (raksasa) of the island of Lanka and a devotee of the goddess Kali. The city of Lanka was later ruled by his descendants, but was conquered by the Pāndavas in the Mahābhārata, and later by the Cholas in the 13th century. The city was later ruled by the Vijayanagar Empire.

Prompt: In biology, cell theory is the historic scientific theory, now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory.<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

[0.628, 0.083]Original response:  Cells are made of cells, and this is a well-known fact in biology today. However, many years ago, this discovery was made possible through the invention of microscopes.

The discovery of cells is a bit more complicated, and many scientists contributed to this idea over time. However, most people agree that Robert Hooke is the first person to discover cells. He discovered cells in the 1660s and is considered the first person to microscopically observe cells.

Hooke was a scientist in the 17 th century, and he made many important discoveries in biology and physics. He is best known for his invention of the microscope, and many people owe their discovery of cells to him.

In many ways, Hooke is similar to the discovery of cells as many people today owe their discovery of the internet to the invention of the internet.

Without the invention of the micropace, many of the discoveries in biology today would not be possible. Cells are a fundamental unit of life, and many scientists have contributed to our understanding of cells over time.

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, the discovery of cells is also attributed to Robert Hooke in 1665, and later, Matthias Schleiden and Rudolph Tirtius. These three are generally credited with the discovery of cells. However, many others also contributed to the development of cell theory. Overall, cell theory is a fundamental concept in biology and is usually taught in many biology classes. Understanding cells is also important in many scientific fields, including medicine, ecology, and agriculture. Cell theory is also a basic concept in many scientific fields.

Prompt: Vascular spasm (Vasoconstriction)-Vasoconstriction is produced by vascular smooth muscle cells, and is the blood vessel's first response to injury. The smooth muscle cells are controlled by vascular endothelium, which releases intravascular signals to control the contracting properties. When a blood vessel is damaged, there is an immediate reflex, initiated by local sympathetic pain receptors, which helps promote vasoconstriction. The damaged vessels will constrict (vasoconstrict) which reduces the amount of blood flow through the area and limits the amount of blood loss. Collagen is exposed at the site of injury, the collagen promotes platelets to adhere to the injury site. Platelets release cytoplasmic granules which contain serotonin, ADP and thromboxane A2, all of which increase the effect of vasoconstriction. The spasm response becomes more effective as the amount of damage is increased. Vascular spasm is much more effective in smaller blood vessels. Platelet plug formation-Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium to form a platelet plug (primary hemostasis) and then degranulate. This process is regulated through thromboregulation. Plug formation is activated by a glycoprotein called Von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is found in plasma. Platelets play one of major roles in the hemostatic process. When platelets come across the injured endothelium cells, they change shape, release granules and ultimately become ' sticky '. Platelets express certain receptors, some of which are used for the adhesion of platelets to collagen. When platelets are activated, they express glycoprotein receptors that interact with other platelets, producing aggregation and adhesion. Platelets release cytoplasmic granules such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin and thromboxane A2. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) attracts more platelets to the affected area, serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction and degranulation. As more chemicals are released more platelets stick and release their chemicals; creating a platelet plug and continuing the process in a positive feedback loop. Platelets alone are responsible for stopping the bleeding of unnoticed wear and tear of our skin on a daily basis. This is referred to as primary hemostasis. Clot formation-Once the platelet plug has been formed by the platelets, the clotting factors (a dozen proteins that travel along the blood plasma in an inactive state) are activated in a sequence of events known as ' coagulation cascade ' which leads to the formation of Fibrin from inactive fibrinogen plasma protein. Thus, a Fibrin mesh is produced all around the platelet plug to hold it in place; this step is called "Secondary Hemostasis". During this process some red and white blood cells are trapped in the mesh which causes the primary hemostasis plug to become harder: the resultant plug is called as ' thrombus ' or ' Clot '. Therefore ' blood clot ' contains secondary hemostasis plug with blood cells trapped in it. Though this is often a good step for wound healing, it has the ability to cause severe health problems if the thrombus becomes detached from the vessel wall and travels through the circulatory system; If it reaches the brain, heart or lungs it could lead to stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary embolism respectively. However, without this process the healing of a wound would not be possible.<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

[0.662, 0.007]Original response:  According to the knowledge provided, the correct sequence of events for when skin is cut and blood occurs is:

1. Vascular spasms (vasoconstriction) - The damaged blood vessels constrict to reduce blood flow to the affected area, which helps to limit the amount of blood loss and promote clotting.
2. Platelet plug formations - Platelets adhere to the damaged endothelial cells and release granules containing serotonin, thromboxane A, and ADP, which promote platelet aggregation and adhesions, forming a platelet plug.
3. Clot formation - The platelet plug is then covered by a fibrin mesh, which is formed through the coagulation cascade, resulting in a thrombus or blood clot.

Therefore, the correct sequence of event is vasoconstriction, platelet plug formation, and clot formation.

Prompt: The Thompson was favored by soldiers, criminals, police, and civilians alike for its large. 45 ACP cartridge, accuracy, and high volume of fully automatic fire. It has since gained popularity among civilian collectors for its historical significance. It has had, and continues to have, considerable significance in popular culture, especially in works about the U.S.'s Prohibition era and World War II, and hence is among the best-known firearms in history. Although the original fully automatic Thompsons are no longer produced, numerous semi-automatic civilian versions are still being manufactured by Auto-Ordnance. These retain a similar appearance to the original models, but they have various modifications in order to comply with US firearm laws.<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Prompt: By convention, the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476, when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus and proclaimed himself ruler of Italy, but this convention is subject to many qualifications. In Roman constitutional theory, the Empire was still simply united under one emperor, implying no abandonment of territorial claims. In areas where the convulsions of the dying Empire had made organized self-defence legitimate, rump states continued under some form of Roman rule after 476. Julius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West and controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480. Syagrius son of Aegidius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487. The indigenous inhabitants of Mauretania developed kingdoms of their own, independent of the Vandals, with strong Roman traits. They again sought Imperial recognition with the reconquests of Justinian I, and they put up effective resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. While the civitates of Britannia sank into a level of material development inferior even to their pre-Roman Iron Age ancestors, they maintained identifiably Roman traits for some time, and they continued to look to their own defence as Honorius had authorized.<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
