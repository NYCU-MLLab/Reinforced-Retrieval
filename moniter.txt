Ground truth: In logical argument and mathematical proof, the therefore sign (∴) is generally used before a logical consequence, such as the conclusion of a syllogism. The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read therefore. It is encoded at U + 2234 ∴ therefore (HTML & # 8756; &there4;).

It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.606, 0.195] Original true response:  According to the knowledge provided, the three dots in the therefore sign (∴), which is used in logical argument and mathematical proof, represent the conclusion of a syllogasm.
[0.528, 0.162] Original ret response:  According to the knowledge provided, the 3 dots in a triangle shape used in mathematics can have different meanings depending on the context and the author. Here are some of the possible meanings:

1. Therefore: In some cases, the 3 dots in triangle shape may be used to indicate "therefore." For example, in Johann Rahn's "Teutsche Algebra" (1659), he used both the "therefore" and "because" signs, and in the 1668 English edition, he used the "because" sign more often to mean "therefore."
2. A list of items: The 3 dots in a triangleshape can also be used to indicate a list of items, similar to an enumeration. For example, in some 18th-century texts, authors used three dots in a triangle to signify "therefore" or "consequently."
3. A pause or a break: The 3 dots in triangle shape can also be used to indicate a pause or a break in the text, similar to an ellipsis. This usage is not specific to mathematics but can be found in various forms of writing.

[0.570, 0.272] Prifix true response: In mathematics and in some information technologies, the three dots (‼), commonly called three dots, therefore ‼ three dots, is an indication of a specific number of elements. In mathematical usage it is used to represent "up to" or "at most" (and therefore "three at most"). For example, " there are at most 3!" means " there are 3 ! = 6 ". (Thus it is used instead of 3 ⋅ !.) It is an alternative notation for the number of elements in a set; and it is used in number theory and in probability theory. It is also used to denote the "up to" or "at the most" in some abstract algebraic structures.
[0.467, 0.107] Prifix ret response: 3 dots also called ternary operator (like three dots), indicate to the reader (other than the author) that the previous expression must be continued indefinitely; therefore, the author would like the reader to continue the expression in their own way instead of indicating the length of the expression in a meaningful way (like in the example "A -> B -> C -> D; the expression would actually be D because there are four dots, not three) A further use of the ternary operator would result in the same; however, as a caution, the author may also specify that the expression should stop at the next given value, but the reader mustn't simply take the expression as being of a limited length

Ground truth: Leading foreign holders of US Treasury securities as of August 2017 Country Billions of dollars (est.) Ratio of owned US debt to 2016 GDP (est.) Percent change since August 2016 China 1,200.5 6% + 1% Japan 1,101.7 22% − 4% Ireland 307.2 105% + 15% Brazil 273.6 15% + 7% Cayman Islands 260.0 n/a − 2% Switzerland 248.3 38% + 4% United Kingdom 225.4 9% + 10% Luxembourg 213.4 359% − 3% Hong Kong 197.3 62% + 3% Taiwan 180.4 34%--5% Others 2,061.9 n/a + 1% Grand total 6,269.7 n/a + 1%
[0.539, 0.161] Original true response:  According to the information provided in the knowledge, as of August 2018, China is the leading foreign holder of US Treasury securties, with holdings of $1,200.5 billion. This represents 6% of the total US debt and 1% of China's 2016 GDP.

To calculate the amount of US debt that China holds, we can use the following formula:

US debt held by China = $1,200.4 billion

To convert this amount to a percentage of China's GDP, we can use the following formula, assuming China's 2017 GDP was around $14 trillion:

Percentage of GDP = $1,200 billion / $14 trillion = 8.5%

So, China holds $1,200. billion of US debt, which is equivalent to 8.5% of its GDP.
[0.447, 0.093] Original ret response:  According to the knowledge provided, China is one of the countries that holds a significant amount of U.S. debt.

This represents about 14% of the total U.S. debt held by foreign governments.

However, it's important to note that the amount of U.S. debts denominated in U.S. dollars that China holds may have changed since February 2022, as the total amount of U.S. debit held by China could have fluctuated due to various economic and political factors.

China holds 17.2 % of total US government debt, 16.2 % of total US agency debt, 17.8 % of total US corporate debt, and 10.7 % of total US household debt as of August 31,2017.

where does the term dog and pony show come from [/INST]
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Over time, the term "dog and poney show" came to be used metaphorically to describe any performance or event that is seen as insincere or lacking in substance, particularly in politics or business.
[0.647, 0.223] Prifix true response: The term was originally used in the 18th century in the United States to describe the various acts and displays that traveling performers presented to entertain local communities. These acts often featured trained dogs and other animals performing tricks and stunts, as well as trained ponies and other horses. The term was originally "dog and pony show" and was first recorded in 1790. Dog and pony shows were popular from the late 18th century until the early 20th century. They were originally held in small, out-of-the-way towns and villages, but eventually they began to be staged in larger cities and in circuses. Today, the term "dog and pony show" has expanded to include any sort of traveling performance that is low-budget, low-tech, and travels from town to town. The term is now most commonly used to refer to political events or speeches, but it can be used to describe other events as well.
[0.562, 0.160] Prifix ret response: From the 1980s to the 1990s--this is a period of time where the term "dog and pony show" is used. It is a term that is mainly used in the United States and Canada.

The term is used to suggest that these presentations are less important than they are entertaining, and this is where the pony reference comes from. The term is most commonly used in reference to speeches by politicians, especially in the United States.

who is recognized as the founder of islam [/INST]
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.499, 0.090] Original true response:  According to the knowledge provided, the founder of Islam is the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
[0.477, 0.089] Original ret response:  According to the knowledge provided, the founder of Islam is Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
[0.659, 0.296] Prifix true response: According to traditional Islamic belief, Muhammad was born in Mecca in 570 AD. He was born into a prominent Meccan family, the tribe of Quraysh, which was known for its wealth, power, and influence. Muhammad's father, Abdullah, was killed in a raid when Muhammad was still young, and his mother, Amina, died soon after, so he was raised by his grandfather, Abd al Muttalib. In 610, Muhammad was 40 years old and unmarried. He was then known as al Amin, which means The Trustworthy, and was highly respected among his people. He later received revelations from Allah through the angel Gabriel (Jibril), which would later form the basis of Islam. In 622, Muhammad migrated to Medina, where he would establish the first Islamic community. His migration was seen as a momentous event in Islamic history, marking the beginning of the Islamic calendar.
[0.520, 0.162] Prifix ret response: That was a very important event. Muhammad was a religious and political leader. The Quran was the primary source of Muhammad's authority. This also gave the idea of the unity of God and the belief of prophets as chosen and appointed by God. The Qu'ran also introduced the Islamic system of social justice and equality. The Shari'ah and the Sunnah were also introduced to govern the personal conduct of believers and the state affairs. The idea of a universal caliphate and the religiously based international state (ummah) also had a significant impact. The ultimate political goal of Islam is the "establishment of the Islamic state (khilāfa), as the form of society where the principles of the Qur'an and the Prophetic way of life are implemented.

Compare the proof-of-life scheme to the concept of the ultimate question: "What is the meaning of life ?" The proof-of-life scheme can be seen as a more practical approach to the question, but still fails to deliver a satisfactory answer. Nevertheless, the proof-of-life concept provides a new perspective on the meaning of life, and is a testament to the complexity of the question.

The conditions of parole may include regular meetings with a parole officer, employment or education requirements, and restrictions on activities such as travel or association with certain individuals.

For first-degree murder convictions, an individual may be eligible for parole after serving at least 25 years of their sentence, provided they have been deemed to be a model prisoner and have shown that they are unlikely to commit further crimes.

when does a limit of a function not exist [/INST]
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.669, 0.264] Original true response:  According to the formal definition provided, a limit of a function does not exist if some inputs very close to a given point (called the "point of interest") are taken to outputs that stay afixed distance apart. In other words, if the function does not approach a specific value as the input gets arbitrarily close to the point of interest, then the limit does not exist at that point.
[0.553, 0.177] Original ret response:  According to the knowledge provided, a limit of a function does not exist in certain situations, including:

1. As special cases limits on an interval: The limit of a function may not exist at a point if the function is not defined on the entire interval containing that point. For example, the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a may not exist if f(x) is only defined for x > a or x < a.
2. Left-handed limits: The limit of a function as s approaches a from the left may not exist if the function is not defined on a half-open interval of the form (−∞,a) or (a,∞). For example, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 from the left may not exist if f(x)$ is only defined for x > 0.
3. Right-handed limits: The limitof a function as s approaches a fromthe right may not exist if the function isnot defined on a half-open intervalof the form (a,∞) or (−∞,a). For example, the limit off(x) as x approaches ∞ from the right may not exist if f(x
[0.568, 0.223] Prifix true response: Graphs, first, second, third, and fourth derivatives, functions, functions as limits. First, an antiderivative is a function F (x) that has a derivative equal to another function F (x) and is the inverse derivative of that function. The antiderivative is a function f (x) and the derivative is f (x), the derivative is f (x), and the derivative is f (x). A derivative is the same as an antiderivative. The derivative is a function f (x) that has a derivative f (x), and the derivative f (x) is equal to f (x).
[0.606, 0.191] Prifix ret response: As an infinitesimal sequence approaches a point, as an example, the limit of the quotient of the distance (L 1 (x, y)) from x to y (y, x) approaches a value of zero. In contrast, the limit of a function f (x) as x approaches a, (l, m) does not exist if there exists a ε > 0, so (x - l) > ε. A function can also have a non-existent limit (i.e., l ≠ f (l)) if f (x) has a discontinuity at l (l, m). Finally, the limit of a function does not exist if the function fails to be defined at the point (l, m).

Ground truth: As of 2017, the following 15 countries or regions have reached an economy of at least US $2 trillion by GDP in nominal or PPP terms: Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
[0.541, 0.198] Original true response:  According to the knowledge provided, as of 2017, Germany, the UK, and Russia are among the 15 countries or regions with an economy of at least US $ 2 trillion by GDP.

All three countries have a market-based economy, which means that economic decisions are made by the interaction of individual consumers and businesses and prices are determined by supply and demand. This is a characteristic of capitalism, which is the dominant economic system in these countries.

In addition, all three countries have a high level of economic development, with a large and complex industrial base, a well-developed financial system, and a high standard of living for their citizens.

However, there are some differences in the economic systems of these countries. For example:

* Germany has a highly developed service sector, with a strong focus on engineering and technology, while the UK has a more diversified economy, with a significant contribution from the financial sector.
* Russia has a mixed economy, with a significant role for the state in strategic sectors such as energy and defense, while Germany and the UK have more market-oriented economies.

Based on the studies published by these agencies, here are some common features of the economic systems of the UK, Germany, and Russia:

1. Market-based economy: All three countries have market-based economies, where the production and distribution of goods and services are guided by the forces of supply and demand.
2. Mixed economy: While the UK and Germany have mixed economies with a significant role for the public sector, Russia has a more state-dominated economy.
3. Capitalist system: All three countries have a capitalist system, where private individuals and businesses own and operate the means of production, and profit motive drives economic activity.
4. Free market principles: The UK, Germany, and Russia all have a commitment to free market principles, such as competition and deregulation, which are intended to promote economic efficiency and innovation
[0.621, 0.167] Prifix true response: As an economic system, the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia have an open market or mixed economy predominantly based on market forces of supply and demand and involving both public ownership and private ownership of the means of production, or a mixed economy, in the economy of the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, France, Portugal, Austria, Iceland, Czech Republic, Israel, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, South Africa, India, Malaysia, Turkey
[0.447, 0.075] Prifix ret response: In Europe, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, social democracy and social market economies are prevalent. Social democracy and social market economies share certain features: 1) Strong safety net (minimum living standards, unemployment insurance, health care, education, etc.) 2) Increased state intervention and ownership in certain industries (e.g. energy, transportation, water) 3) Significant private property rights 4) Efficient government services 5) Regulated market economies 6) Workers participate in the political process through trade unions.

Ground truth: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.
[0.598, 0.265] Original true response:  According to the knowledge provided, Beryl Markham flew across the Atlantic Ocean on September 4, 1936. She took off from Abingdon,England and landed at Baleine Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada after a 20-hour flight. Therefore, the answer to the question "When did Beryl Markham fly across the Atlantic?" is: September 4, 1926.
[0.563, 0.127] Original ret response:  According to the knowledge provided, Beryl Markham successfully flew across the Atlantic from east to west non-stop in 1930, making her the first woman to accomplish this feat.
[0.601, 0.217] Prifix true response: When she finally took to the air on 1 September 1936, Beryl Markham had had enough of being snubbed by the men who had had all the glory of flight, and she wanted to be the first woman to cross the Atlantic solo. She had made several failed attempts on an open-copped biplane she had designed herself, and, after the failure of her fourth attempt, she rebuilt her aircraft from a fabric-covered steel tube. Her first flight across the Atlantic took 18 hours, 45 minutes, and landed her in the harbour at Canso, Nova Scotia. She became an instant celebrity and her name was known across the world. After that she set several other records.
[0.591, 0.173] Prifix ret response: Because of her experiences as a child on a colonial farm, Markham was invited to join a group of wealthy women on a plane. On 19 May 1936, she became the first woman to cross the Atlantic east to west, some 28 days before Amelia Earhart. She made the flight solo in her de Havilland Gypsy Moth plane, The Berylmark (named after herself). The weather was bad for most of the flight, making it the most challenging part of her journey. She flew for over 20 hours a day, from Darlington, England to Toronto, Canada.

where does eye of the round roast come from [/INST]
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.556, 0.197] Original true response:  According to the knowledge provided, the eye of round roast comes from the "eye" cut of the round, which is a cut of beef from the rear leg of the cow.
[0.595, 0.278] Original ret response:  According to the knowledge provided, "eye of the round" is a cut of beef that comes from the round primal cut. Specifically, it is the most tender and flavorful part of the round, which is located near the hip of the cow. The eye of the round roast is a popular cut for roasting, as it is tender and juicy, and can be cooked to a variety of temperatures to suit different tastes.
[0.654, 0.327] Prifix true response: A round roast is a cut of beef from the primal "round". The round is the hindquarters of the cow, including the rump (rump roast), the loin (tenderloin and sirloin tip roast), and the round, including the eye of round (e.g., rump roast, eye of round roast). The eye of round is a very lean cut of meat. The lean cuts are on the bottom and the fattier cuts are on top. When cooking the eye of round roast, it is often cut into steaks or roasted and cooked. The eye of round is often less tender and thicker than tenderloin. When cooked to the right temperature, the meat is tender and juicy. Often the eye of round is less expensive than tenderloin.
[0.471, 0.147] Prifix ret response: The American English term "eye of the round" (e.g. "round roast with eyes" or "eye of round roast") can sometimes also occur in North American English (e.g. "eye of round roast with vegetables"). From 1800 to 1830, American and British English vocabularies were merged and influenced by other dialects from the Atlantic world, including Caribbean English and Native American English; these influences are found in American English words and phrases from the period, and continue to this day. From 1900 to 1920, American English experienced a period of Americanization (Americanization of British English), resulting in a significant number of words from American English becoming current in British English.

where do bullets go when fired in the air [/INST]
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.712, 0.342] Original true response:  According to the knowledge provided, bullets fired into the air usually fallback with terminal velocities much lower than the muzzle velocity when they leave a firearm.
[0.776, 0.578] Original ret response:  According to the knowledge provided, bullets fired into the air usually falls back with terminal velocities much lower their muzzle velocity when they leaves the barrel of a firearm, but people can still be injured, sometimes fatally, by bullets discharged into the  air that fall back down to the ground.
[0.647, 0.243] Prifix true response: Bullets usually travel at much higher velocities than bullets fired at sea level when they are fired at high altitudes where the air pressure is lower. Bullets can travel at velocities up to 2,000 mph, however, the air pressure at sea level is significantly higher than at higher altitudes. When fired at higher altitudes the bullet is less likely to penetrate its target; therefore it is often considered more effective to use a bullet that is less likely to penetrate at lower altitudes than at sea level.
[0.627, 0.203] Prifix ret response: Bullets usually fall back to the ground unless they are spin stabilized to be less affected by gravity in flight so they can fly a longer distance. Bullets are fired at very high velocities, up to 300 mph, so when they fall back to the ground, they are simply moving too fast to be shot down by another weapon or slowed by friction. A bullet fired at a range of 100 yards is in the atmosphere for only 2.5 seconds and it takes the bullet 0.6 seconds to travel up to its peak altitude; the remaining 1.9 seconds is the time it takes to fall back to the ground.

Ground truth: Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould. Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

[0.646, 0.250] Prifix true response: Johannes Gutenberg is, in effect, the first person to achieve a major breakthrough in printing technology, in the Western world. A German goldsmith by training, Gutenberg was the first to create a printing press using movable type. His inventions in type metal casting, casting for printing, and ink were revolutionary in achieving cheaper books and more consistent output. Gutenberg's achievements were made possible by the introduction of a new ink, the adaptation of an existing wine press to print in both directions, and the design of movable type pieces cast in lead. With Gutenberg's printing-press innovations, all Western literature from the Renaissance through the Enlightenment was printed from moveable type.
[0.596, 0.191] Prifix ret response: To illustrate the moveable-type printing process, woodcut blocks were glued together on a wooden frame. By the mid-15th century, a few moveable-type printing presses were being built and used; a very influential example was the invention of the first moveable-type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith and printer. Gutenberg was born around 1400 and grew up in Mainz; his innovations and wealth made him a very important person to both the church and the political leaders of the time.

Prompt: what do the 3 dots mean in math
Ground truth: In logical argument and mathematical proof, the therefore sign (∴) is generally used before a logical consequence, such as the conclusion of a syllogism. The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read therefore. It is encoded at U + 2234 ∴ therefore (HTML & # 8756; &there4;). For common use in Microsoft Office hold the ALT key and type "8756". While it is not generally used in formal writing, it is used in mathematics and shorthand. It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.516, 0.171] Original true response: In addition to also meaning "you know what I mean", the series also uses the 3 dots in elementary math to indicate functions, but only very rarely use them in calculus; because the number of functions in this series is so large, it is hard to get a handle on how they are defined. It is said that the three dots are simply there to represent the author's failure to write down all the functions in the book. In summary, the three dots (Ω) in mathematics (and other fields) serve a variety of purposes. The use of a three-dot symbol is not widespread. It is not part of a common mathematical notation.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.501, 0.139] Original true response: From the start of the show--these dogs are bred to be very "pony-like". They are actually called a "Basset Hound". This breed is "pony-like" because they are so short and are usually dark. So they will be able to stand on the pony show grounds with the ponies and not be any taller than the ponies. These dogs are bred to be small and to be taller than normal dogs. This is the reason they are called pony-like. The name pony is used because of this breed. They are small and pony-like. They are about the same height as ponies and look like ponies. This is why the show is called the pony show. So this is where the term dog and pony show comes from. This term is used to describe any kind of show.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.576, 0.236] Original true response: That was a successful translation. The Muslim world was founded by the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Muhammad is the last prophet of God, also known as the Prophet of Islam. The Quran was revealed to him by Allah through the archangel Jibril. The majority of Muslims today believe that he had a miraculous birth. His father, Abdullah, had been adopted by a prominent Meccan clan, the Banu Hashim, and thus Muhammad's mother Aminah was descended from their clan. His marriage to Khadija, a wealthy and successful businesswoman, marked the beginning of his prophetic mission (which would eventually lead to the formation of the Islamic faith).

Prompt: who won the champions league final in 2016
Ground truth: The 2016 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2015--16 UEFA Champions League, the 61st season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 24th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy, on 28 May 2016, between Spanish teams Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, in a repeat of the 2014 final. It was the second time in the tournament's history that both finalists were from the same city.

The match was played on the San Siro stadium, home of the Inter Milan (hosts) against Real Madrid (visitors). Real Madrid won this match 1--0 (1--0), and thus won their 11th European Cup. A first goal in the 3rd minute by Gareth Bale was enough to decide the outcome of the game, as the second half was almost exclusively controlled by the Madrid team. As for the goal, a misjudgement of the goalkeeper allowed Bale to score after a long-range shot. Madrid won the competition in a two-horse race after Bayern Munich lost in the quarter-finals.

Prompt: who wrote the text for jeanie with the light brown hair
Ground truth: "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair" is a parlor song by Stephen Foster (1826--1864). It was published by Firth, Pond & Co. of New York in 1854. Foster wrote the song with his estranged wife Jane McDowell in mind. The lyrics allude to a permanent separation.
[0.542, 0.211] Original true response: Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair with the title, "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair," written by Stephen Vincent Benet, the author of the story. It was first published in The Atlantic in December  1924 (volume 134, no.  467). In this story, Stephen Vincent Benet told the story of a boy named Tommy who grew up in a poor Irish neighborhood. When Tommy finds a small fortune, he buys a ring for Jeanie, a girl with light brown hair. Tommy soon discovers that Jeanie is married; his friends taunt him with cruel words, but Tommy, filled with sadness, insists that he will remain Jeanie's friend.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.543, 0.127] Original true response: As an infinite series as an example may be divergent, a series as an infinite sum of terms by an infinite geometric series (i.e., an infinite sum of terms, each of which is obtained by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number). It may be shown to be divergent by taking the limit of the partial sums of the series as the partial sum increases, which does not approach any finite value. In other words, no finite limit exists in the series. In the same way, a limit of a function may not exist if the function does not converge (i.e., the function does not approach a finite value as the variable goes to infinity). In particular, the limit of a function does not exist if the function has a pole (i.e., a point at which the function goes to infinity).

Prompt: what does the sun represent on the uruguay flag
Ground truth: The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay, based on the U.S flag, where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance. The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santillán, the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti, the sun god of the Inca religion. It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia.
[0.594, 0.230] Original true response: According to the Uruguayan Constitution of 1997; the red and white stripes were adopted from the flag of Buenos Aires, which was under Spanish influence. The adoption of a red and white striped flag was a deliberate rejection of the influence of the Spanish flag, the red and white flag of Castile, which was associated with Spanish colonialism. The white and red colors were also used by the Celtiberian and Celtic tribes. The sun was first introduced on the national flag by President Félix Óptimo Muttoni on 25 August 1828. The use of the sun was due to the ideal of the sun representing the vital and active principles of the country.

Prompt: when did beryl markham fly across the atlantic
Ground truth: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.
[0.580, 0.149] Original true response: Because of a severe storm on her first attempt, Beryl Markham and a crew of two made a good on the island of Ascension. They continued on to a base in the Azores, where Markham took over a smaller plane, finishing her solo journey with only a few hours to spare. Markham became the first woman to make the Atlantic crossing on her own. The flight took 19 days (1936). Markham flew a Percival Vega Gull monoplane, a sturdy two-seat biplane; a year later, she set a record for the highest altitude flown by a woman in a powered aircraft (23,687 feet). In 1947, she attempted to fly solo from the United Kingdom to Australia, making the first leg of the flight in a Percival Provence.

Prompt: who wrote most of the declaration of independance
Ground truth: United States Declaration of Independence 1823 facsimile of the engrossed copy Created June--July 1776 Ratified July 4, 1776 Location Engrossed copy: National Archives Rough draft: Library of Congress Author (s) Thomas Jefferson et al. (engrosser: probably Timothy Matlack) Signatories 56 delegates to the Continental Congress Purpose To announce and explain separation from Great Britain

A wealthy landowner in Virginia, Jefferson wrote the most of the Declaration, which was then edited by a committee of five men. One of whom, John Adams of Massachusetts, took a leading role in its presentation to Congress and was given the task of writing the formal announcement of independence to the people. While Jefferson is credited with the main body of the Declaration, there were earlier and widespread influences; some of his own pre-existing drafts were largely drawn from earlier models, while some of his writing was inspired by similarities to the British works of John Locke.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.593, 0.258] Original true response: A round roast is a cut of beef from the rear quarter, including the eye muscle. The "eye" is the darker, fattier eye muscle (the most tender part), and is a popular roast-cut (when cooked with the bone on, the cut is more tender), particularly for family gatherings and special occasions: holidays, dinner parties, barbecues, and camping trips- this is where the term ` eye of the round roast ` comes from. This beef roast is also occasionally used for the dish ` roast beef with roasted vegetables ` (usually potatoes, carrots, onions, and sometimes cabbage or Brussels sprouts).

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.639, 0.236] Original true response: Bullets usually leave the barrel of the gun at the same velocity they leave the muzzle of the gun when they are fired, so the bullet can go any direction. In the case of a bullet fired in air, it will be deflected back to the ground, unless it is fired at a high enough angle of entry and therefore a trajectory is calculated to be at a lower angle than the angle of impact; the bullet may penetrate a few feet into the ground at a higher angle of entry and is often effective in attacking targets behind barriers. The exact behavior of a bullet in flight is determined by the shape and size of the bullet and its trajectory and the spin imparted upon it.

Prompt: what was icq as related to instant messaging
Ground truth: ICQ is an instant messaging client that was first developed and popularized by the Israeli company Mirabilis in 1996. The name ICQ derives from the English phrase "I Seek You". Ownership of ICQ passed from Mirabilis to AOL in 1998, and from AOL to Mail.Ru Group in 2010.
[0.486, 0.164] Original true response: ICQ saved much space through its use of delta encoding. Whenever two ICQ users exchanged messages (called "pinging"), ICQ (along with other instant messaging systems, see "MIME") used delta encoding. This allowed ICQ to store all messages in a compact binary format, and extract any new messages by comparing the delta between the current state and the previous state. The delta encoding was so efficient that ICQ could store a message in about 12 bytes. A similar approach to delta encoding was used in the Jabber instant messaging system (based upon a specification called the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, or XMPP), to reduce the size of instant messages (IMs).

Prompt: when was the national flag of india adopted
Ground truth: The National Flag of India is a horizontal rectangular tricolour of India saffron, white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre. It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term "tricolour" (Hindi: तिरंगा, translit. Tiraṅgā) almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya.
[0.574, 0.233] Original true response: Independence and freedom, Gandhi and Nehru, developed democracy and democratic traditions. Adopted 24 August 1947 became the National flag of India, after a long period of evolution. The flag's tricolor design was adopted on 22 August 1947, when the Indian National Congress adopted it. The flag's design was first proposed by the Indian National Congress, and its first President, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on 22 August 1889. The first National Flag was hoisted on 22 August 1308, when the Tata Steel and Tata Motors company's head office was shifted to Mumbai.

Prompt: when was the death penalty reinstated in oregon
Ground truth: In 1984, Measure 6 amended the state constitution to once more make the death penalty legal. Measure 7, a statutory measure passed in the same year, required a separate sentencing hearing before a jury in cases of aggravated murder.
[0.564, 0.135] Original true response: "Death penalty" was abolished in Oregon, by vote of the people in 1994 and has been enforced by law since 1995. Therefore, the death penalty was never reinstated, and the legislation was in effect until 2006. Voters in 2006 passed Ballot Measure 49, thereby prohibiting the death penalty. The Oregon capital punishment statutes were amended to remove the death penalty and allow the use of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. The state has since, therefore, been using only life imprisonment. However, Oregon's death penalty was in place between 1994 and 2006.

Prompt: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany
Ground truth: Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould. Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.
[0.590, 0.210] Original true response: To spread the spread of moveable-type printing, blocks of metal, wood or stone were made by printers. The technology of moveable-type printing was so valuable that a number of cities and countries, even China and the Islamic world, had developed it by the 1100s. The moveable-type printing press made it possible to mass-produce and distribute books on a scale never before imagined, and was a factor in the Reformation and the spread of literacy and education. The first book on moveable-type printing was created by Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith and printer.

Prompt: what was the alliance between great britian russia and france known as
Ground truth: The Triple Entente (from French entente (ɑ̃tɑ̃t) "friendship, understanding, agreement") refers to the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, was a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.
[0.500, 0.172] Original true response: During the war a treaty was signed between Britain and France. Although it was to be secret, and although it was leaked to the press, it was still widely reported. Britain's anti-French propaganda saw the alliance (often inaccurately) in terms of a Russian-French plot against Britain, and the French were resentful that Britain was not returning the property of French citizens that had been confiscated in 1793, 1803 and 1807. In the French view, Napoleon's pragmatic approach to the treaty was in contrast to that of the British, who, in an attempt to protect the wealthy Indian Ocean trade, and Britain's naval superiority, and the fear of Russian expansionism, were demanding restrictions that would severely limit Napoleon's ability to wage war.

[0.487, 0.196] Original true response: In addition to also being the title of a book also covered in the  same chapter, the phrase appears in Euler's preface to his Analysis deskriptiven, but the main function of these equations is still not clear; in particular Euler's paper provides no proof for the value of the coefficients. This use of dots as an abbreviation of pi is said to be unique to the Analysis, but it is not clear how widely it was ever adopted. (In fact Euler did not use it; in his work the symbol π is used.) The importance of the third-dot notation is not emphasized in Euler's work.

[0.509, 0.197] Original true response: In addition to the usual definitions in the course also discussed the meaning of three dots in mathematics, but found little to use; therefore, decided to continue with the rest of the course. This comment, as well as many others, shows that people are confused about what these dots mean in mathematics. There is no common definition for the three dots; they are simply a placeholder for future mathematical results. It is said that in the future there will be a mathematical formula (3 dots) but it has not yet been discovered. The three dots are often used in a mathematical formula to indicate a missing value. This is a common practice in many fields of mathematics.

Ground truth: Since 1947, there have been eight Chief Ministers of West Bengal. The first was Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of the Indian National Congress, who was succeeded by his party-mates Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy and Prafulla Chandra Sen. A decade of instability followed, marred by fractious coalition governments and frequent impositions of President's rule.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.573, 0.202] Original true response: From the late 19th century--1800s--onwards. It is a slang term in the United States. It means a public relations stunt. This term originated from a vaudeville act: "dog and pony show" from the 1880s. This act was a comedy act featuring a dog and a pony. This act was performed on the stage. The dog and pony show was a stunt in which the dog and pony were shown to be untrainable and would not perform tricks. The dog and pony show ended with the dog and pony running off stage. The stunt was a huge success. The audience laughed at the antics of the dog and pony.

[0.425, 0.059] Original true response: U.S. debt to China's trade, as measured by a balance of trade (BOT) is relatively small compared to U.S. total public debt (see chart below). This is because of trade imbalances between the U.S. and China. China's surplus in trade with the U.S. has been the main factor in the rise of the U.S. trade deficit since the 1990s. In 2007, China's trade surplus with the U.S. peaked at $272 billion, while in 2008 the U.S. trade defict was 700 billion dollars, while the U.S. trade deficeit was $700 billion.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.537, 0.198] Original true response: That was a very significant period. The Prophet Muhammad was a major prophet. The Islamic prophet and religious leader Muhammad is also known as the founder of Islam. The central religious text of Islam also contains the revelations of Allah to Muhammad. The Islamic prophet and leader Muhammad had a profound impact on the social, political, and religious history of the Middle East and beyond, and his legacy continues to influence the lives of millions of people around the world today. His teachings, embodied in the Qur'an and the Hadith, have spread across the world and are practiced by millions of people. The Islamic world was born in the Arabian Peninsula, spreading across the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond.

When Sandy and Danny are reunited, they are initially elated, but Danny soon slips back into his greaser attitude, which offends Sandy. At the same rally, Kenickie reveals his new car, a dilapidated used jalopy, and announces he has entered it into a "pinks" street race at Thunder Road.
[0.540, 0.138] Original true response: In the musical's storyline, the race was held at the track that belonged to the Burger Palace, the drive-in restaurant owned by Vince Fontaine, Rydell High's de facto student body president, including Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson's girlfriend, Stephanie Zinone. Fontaine also served as the master of ceremonies (MC) at the event, which is also the venue where Danny and Sandy (also known as Danny Zuko and Sandra Dee) first meet and fall in love. Danny also wins the race, which also leads to his rivalry with the T-Birds (Pat, Doody, Sonny, and Kenickie) and his subsequent falling out with his friends, who also feel disrespected by his treatment of them.

Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.503, 0.100] Original true response: As an infinite sequence increases, as an infinite series diverges, as a function grows by taking on larger values (infinite), as a limit of a function exists, the function can take on an infinite number of values, the limit of a function exists. The limit of a function can be found by using the definition of the derivative (in calculus), by using the definition of the integral (in calculus), by using the method of infinite series (in calculus), or by using the method of Taylor series (in calculus). No mathematical or logical inconsistencies are implied in the above definition, but a finite number of values (i.e., the number of values of the function).

Prompt: when did beryl markham fly across the atlantic
Ground truth: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.

She had a custom-built plane, the Westland, and on 20 July 1932 became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, from east to west. She also set the first woman transatlantic flight record. Markham made a second Atlantic crossing (from east to west) on 1933. The first female pilot to cross the Atlantic solo was Amy Johnson. She completed the journey on 9 May 1930. Markham also became the first woman to fly solo from Cape Town to London, a distance of 1,600 miles (2,600 km), on 17 August 1933.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.643, 0.277] Original true response: A round roast is a cut of beef from the short loin, consisting of the eye and the tenderloin. The "eye" of the roast (sometimes spelled "eye roast" or "eye steak") is the cut of meat from the eye of the animal (or the rear of the animal), including the eyeball and the surrounding tissue. This is considered a premium cut of meat and is usually lean and tender, with a distinctive flavor from the short loin and the marbling of fat in the tissue. A well-cooked eye roast can be a juicy and flavorful centerpiece for a dinner party, and is often served with vegetables and a gravy.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.585, 0.185] Original true response: Bullets usually lose enough velocity when they penetrate the atmosphere that they can not be seen with the naked eye even if they are still airborne. When a bullet is fired at a velocity of about 1,200 mph, its air resistance is so great that it is almost impossible to maintain a stable trajectory; therefore, it is often necessary to use a trajectory chart to predict the trajectory of a bullet. The charts are prepared for a particular caliber of firearm and are the only means by which a shooter can accurately predict the trajectory of his bullets.

Prompt: when does canada switch to daylight savings time
Ground truth: In regions where daylight saving time is used, it commences on the second Sunday of March, and standard time restarts on the first Sunday in November.
[0.480, 0.134] Original true response: Daylight saving time in Canada takes place in accordance with Canada Time Act (Statutes of Canada, 1970, ch.  14 (2nd Supplement)), which allows most provinces and territories to switch between standard and daylight time. The Act specifies the dates (dates) when most provinces and territories (with the exception of Saskatchewan and parts of Quebec) must switch between standard and daylight time (although the dates may vary slightly, due to the different time zones). However, there are two exceptions: Saskatchewan and parts thereof are exempt from observing daylight saving time, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories are also exempt, though the latter two do observe most other federal regulations.

Prompt: what was the alliance between great britian russia and france known as
Ground truth: The Triple Entente (from French entente (ɑ̃tɑ̃t) "friendship, understanding, agreement") refers to the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, was a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.
[0.535, 0.172] Original true response: The Treaty of Alliance and the Anglo-French Alliance were mutual defense treaties between Britain and France. Although the two were not formally allied until 1904, the two countries had cooperated on many military operations during the Crimean War. The treaty was also violated with both nations having secretly armed the Serbs against the Ottoman Empire in the Balkan Wars. It was also violated in World War I, as the French failed to fulfill their pledges to the British in 1915. The failure of the treaty was caused by the mutual distrust of the two nations. The two nations did not have a long-term alliance, and the alliance was not renewed after the war.

Prompt: when was the death penalty reinstated in oregon
Ground truth: In 1984, Measure 6 amended the state constitution to once more make the death penalty legal. Measure 7, a statutory measure passed in the same year, required a separate sentencing hearing before a jury in cases of aggravated murder.
[0.548, 0.133] Original true response: "Death penalty" was never abolished in Oregon, and therefore has never been reinstated.

Prompt: when was the national flag of india adopted
Ground truth: The National Flag of India is a horizontal rectangular tricolour of India saffron, white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre. It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term "tricolour" (Hindi: तिरंगा, translit. Tiraṅgā) almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya.
[0.569, 0.301] Original true response: Adopted, official and civil ensigns, and national flag were approved and adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947. The flag was adopted on 15 August 1947, the day that India became independent. The flag's red, yellow, and green colors were chosen because they were the colors of the Indian National Congress; the white stripe, on the other hand, was a compromise between the Congress and the Muslim League. The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League were the two major political parties that fought the Indian independence movement; the Muslim League was led by Jinnah and the Congress Party was led by Gandhi.
================================================================================
Prompt: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany
Ground truth: Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould. Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.
[0.570, 0.206] Original true response: To illustrate the new invention, Gutenberg created a series of small, movable metal pieces--letters, spaces, and punctuation marks. Because these pieces were arranged and attached to a metal spine, they could be rearranged and reused; and because they were made of metal, they could be moved easily and quickly. The result was a printing press with a high level of quality and speed; and the movable-type printing press was the key to Gutenbergs invention. The metal pieces were made from a soft metal, and Gutenbergs printers were able to use them with a specially-designed ink and a press.
