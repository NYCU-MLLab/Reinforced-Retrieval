Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

The term has since been used more broadly to refer to any kind of show or presentation that is perceived as lacking in substance or coherence.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words"). The term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word.
[0.000, 0.138, 0.509] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, if a prisoner is sentenced to serve no less than 2 years, they will be sent to a federal correction facility. Parole is an option for most prisoners, but it is not guaranteed, particularly for prisoners serve life or indeterminate sentences (KNOW).

In cases of first-degree murder, a prisoner can apply for parole after 12 years if convicted of a single homicide. However, if convicted of multiple murder, the sentencing judge has the option of making parole ineligibility periods sequential, extending parole ineligibility for more than 25 years, and in rare cases, beyond that (KNOW).

Therefore, being on parole means that the prisoner has been released from prison on conditional release, subject to certain conditions and supervision by a parole officer, after serving a portion of their sentence. The parolee must comply with these conditions and demonstrate that they are ready to reintegrate into society before their parole can be granted.

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.
[0.067, 0.202, 0.585] Agent refined response: The origins of the Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, can be traced back to the early Christian Church. The practice of meditating on the Passion of Jesus Christ through the stations of the cross became popular in the Middle Ages, particularly during the Crusades.

The exact origin of the Stations of the Cross is unclear, but it is believed to have originated in Jerusalem during the 4th or 5th century. According to tradition, a devout Christian named Egeria, who traveled to the Holy Land in the 4th century, wrote about visiting the sites where Jesus was crucified, buried, and resurrected. Her account includes a description of a path of 14 stations, which became the basis for the modern Stations of the Cross.

The Stations of the Cross gained popularity throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, particularly during Lent. The practice of meditating at each station became a way for Christians to reflect on the suffering and death of Jesus and to prepare for Easter.

The traditional 14 stations of the cross are:

1. Jesus is condemned to death by Pontius Pilate
2. Jesus is scourged and crowned with thorns
3. Jesus carries his cross
4. Jesus meets his mother, Mary
5. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross
6. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus
7. Jesus falls the first time
8. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem
9. Jesus falls the second time
10. Jesus is stripped of his clothes
11. Jesus is nailed to the cross
12. Jesus dies on the cross
13. Jesus is taken down from the cross
14. Jesus is placed in the tomb

Over time, the Stations of the Cross have evolved, and some variations have emerged. For example, some churches have additional stations, such as the resurrection of Jesus, which is not part of the traditional 14 stations. Additionally, some stations may be rearranged or reworded to better reflect the local culture or tradition.

Despite these variations, the Stations of the Cross remain an important part of Christian devotion and a powerful way for believers to meditate on the Passion of Jesus Christ.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.048, 0.167, 0.549] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, a limit of a function does not exist in the following situations:

1. As $s$ approaches an open interval of the form $(-\infty,a)$, the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$ does not exist.
2. As $s$ approaches anopen interval of the form $(a, \infty)$, the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$ doesnot exist.
3. When $x$ approaches a half-closed interval from the included endpoint, the limit of a function $f(x)$ does no exist.

For example, the limit of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right does not exist, because the function has different limits as $x$ approaches $0+$ and $x$ approaches $0-$.

In general, the limit of a function $ f(x) $ as $x$ approaches $a$ does not exist if $f(x)$ is not defined at $a$, or if the function has different limits as $ x $ approaches $a$ from different directions.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.332, 0.561, 0.804] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, bullets fired into the air usually return to the ground with terminal velocities much lower than the muzzle velocity when they leave a firearm. However, people can still be injured or killed if the bullets fall back down to the ground, even if they have a lower terminal velocity. This is because bullets fired at angles less than perpendicular to the ground maintain their angular ballistic trajectory and travel at speeds much higher than a falling bullet, making them more dangerous.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.000, 0.171, 0.565] Agent refined response: Trigger points are located in the muscles and connective tissue throughout the body. They are areas of muscle tissue that are characterized by hypersensitivity and spasm, and can cause pain and discomfort in the surrounding area. Trigger points can be found in any muscle, but they are most commonly found in the muscles of the neck, back, shoulders, and lower extremities.

There are several ways to locate trigger points in the body, including:

1. Palpation: This involves feeling the muscle for areas of tenderness or spasm.
2. Imaging: Imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans can help identify areas of muscle inflammation or degeneration that may be causing trigger points.
3. Myofascial release: This is a technique that involves applying gentle pressure to the muscle to release tension and relax the trigger point.
4. Trigger point injections: This involves injecting a local anesthetic or steroid into the trigger point to help relax the muscle and reduce pain.

It's important to note that trigger points can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle overuse or injury, poor posture, and nerve irritation. Treating trigger points can help alleviate pain and improve muscle function, but it's important to address the underlying cause of the trigger point as well.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.134, 0.282, 0.641] Agent refined response: Yes, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is mentioned in the United States Declaration of Independence, which is a document adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The Declaration is not a part of the United States Constitution, but it is a foundational document that influenced the writing of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The Declaration states that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." This phrase has been interpreted to mean that individuals have inherent rights that cannot be taken away by any government or authority, and that these rights include the right to life, liberty, freedom of thought and expression, and the pursuit of happiness.

The Constitution does not explicitly mention the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness," but it does contain provisions that protect these rights, such as the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which states that "no person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to protect the right to life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.000, 0.193, 0.530] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the hormones of the anteriorpituitary gland are created through the following process:

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.000, 0.169, 0.574] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, the secretory cells of endocrore glands secrete their products through the following mechanisms:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, including enzymes, through exocytosis. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin, a type of mucus, through exocytosis.Examples include Brunner's glands, esaphageal glands, and plyoric glands.
3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucus through exocytosis. Exampes include the salivary glands, with the parotid gland being 20% serous.
4. Holocrine secretion occurs when a portion of the cell membrane containing the excretion buds off, releasing the substance from the cell. This mechanism is not mentioned in the provided knowledge.
5. Apocrine secretion occurs when a part of the cell membrane detaches, releasing the substance. This mechanism is not mentioned in he provided knowledge.

In summary, the secretory cells of endoccrine glands secrete their products through exocytosis, with the exception of holocrine and apocrine secretion, which are not mentioned in the provided knowledge.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.030, 0.135, 0.591] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common form of hair loss that affects men. It is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. The genetic component is thought to be inherited from one's parents, while the hormonal component is related to the presence of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced in the body and is known to contribute to hair loss.

Research has shown that the risk of developing male pattern baldness increases with age, with the majority of cases occurring in men over the age of 30. Marital status has also been shown to influence hair loss in cross-sectional studies (NHANES 1).

In addition to genetic and hormonal factors, other factors such as stress, certain medical conditions, and certain medications can also contribute to hair loss. It's important to note that male pattern baldness is a common condition and affects millions of men worldwide.

Animal models of androgenic alopcia have been developed in transgenicmice, chimpanzees, bald uakaris, and stump-tailed macaques. Of these, macaques have demonstrated that DHT can cause hair loss by shrinking the hair follicles and reducing the growth of new hair.

In summary, male pattern baldness is caused by a combination of genetics and hormonal factors, and the risk of developing it increases with age. While stress, medical conditions, and certain medications may also contribute to hair loss, the underlying cause is the presence of DHT in the body.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.000, 0.190, 0.574] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, a dieback or population crash occurs when the rate of reproduction is high relative to the death rate, leading to an overshoot in population growth. This can happen when there are lag effects, meaning that the population growth is not immediately limited by the available resources, leading to an overexploitation of the resources and a subsequent collapse of the population.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.026, 0.225, 0.559] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, cones are located in the following areas of the eye:

* The fovea: Cones are greatly outnumbered by rods in most parts of the Retina, but they are much more numerous in the fovea.
* The periphery: Cones are less numerous than rods in most areas of the Retina, but they outnumber rods in the fovia.

So, the cones are located in the fovea and the periphery of the eye.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.218, 0.486, 0.721] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, connective tissue is found throughout the body, including in the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which are the three outer membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord, are composed of connective tissue and consist of elastic and collagenous fibres, ground substance, and cells.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.000, 0.182, 0.558] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, April Fools' Day is not a public holiday inany country, and there is no specific time when it ends. The day is simply a day when people in some European and Western countries commemorate by playing practical jokes and spread hoaxes, and the pranks are usually exposed by shouting "April Fool!" at the unfortunate victim. Newspapers, magazines, and other published media may also report fake stories, which are usually revealed the next day or in smaller letters below the news section.

HBO is known for producing high-quality, critically acclaimed shows with complex storylines and character development, which often require more time and resources to produce. As a result, HBO shows tend to have shorter seasons compared to network TV shows, which often have longer seasons to accommodate more advertising time and a larger audience.

The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.
[0.093, 0.255, 0.638] Agent refined response: The origins of the Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, can be traced back to the early Christian Church. The practice of meditating on the Passion of Jesus Christ through the stations of the cross became popular in the Middle Ages, particularly during the Crusades.

The first recorded use of the Stations of the Cross was in the 12th century by the Cistercian monks in Jerusalem. They created a series of 14 stations along the Via Dolorosa, the route believed to have been taken by Jesus during his trial, scourging, and crucifixion. The stations were designed to help pilgrims meditate on the events of Jesus' Passion and to relive his suffering.

The practice of the Stations of the Cross then spread throughout Europe, particularly in Italy and Spain, where it became an important part of the devotional life of the Catholic Church. The stations were often located in churches, monasteries, and other religious institutions, and were typically marked by a series of plaques or sculptures depicting the various scenes of the Passion.

Over time, the number of stations in the Stations of the Cross has varied, with some traditions using as few as seven or as many as 17 stations. The traditional  number of stations, however, is 14, which corresponds to the number of stations along the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem.

In addition to their religious significance, the Stations of the Cross have also played an important role in the cultural and artistic heritage of Europe. Many famous artists, including Michelangelo, Bernini, and Caravaggio, have created works of art inspired by the stations of the cross, and the practice of meditating on thePassion of Jesus has become an integral part of Catholic devotional life.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.051, 0.173, 0.545] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, a limit of a function does not exist in the following situations:

1. As $s$ approaches an open interval of the form $(-\infty,a)$, the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$ does not exist.
2. As $s$ approaches anopen interval of the form $(a, \infty)$, the limit of a real- valued function $f(x)$ doesnot exist.
3. When $x$ approaches a half-closed interval from the included endpoint, the limit of a function $f(x)$ does  not exist.

For example, the limit of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right does not exist, because the function has different limits as $x$ approaches $0+$ and $x$ approaches $0-$.

In general, the limit of a function $ f(x) $ as $x$ approaches $a$ does not exist if the function has different limits as $ x $ approaches $a$ from different directions.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.

They are areas of muscle tissue that are characterized by hypersensitivity and spasm, and can cause pain in a localized or referred manner. Trigger points can be located in any muscle, but they are most commonly found in the muscles of the neck, back, arms, and legs.

Some common locations for trigger points include:

* Neck and shoulder muscles: Trigger points in the neck and shoulder muscles can cause pain in the shoulder, arm, and hand.
* Back muscles: Trigger points in these muscles can cause pain in the back, as well as in the legs and buttocks.
* Chest muscles: Trigger points in this area can cause pain in the chest, shoulder, and arm.
* Abdominal muscles: Trigger points in abdominal muscles can cause pain in the abdomen, back, and legs.
* Lower leg muscles: Trigger points in muscles of the lower leg can cause pain in the knee, ankle, and foot.

It's important to note that trigger points can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle overuse or strain, injury, or underlying conditions such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.073, 0.249, 0.603] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the term "pop music" originated in the 1950s and 1960s, as a catch-all term for popular music that was not classified under other genres such as rock, jazz, or country. The term was used to describe music that was in line with the tastes of the urban middle class, and was characterized as "instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers" in contrast to "album-based music for adults."

The term "pop song" was first recorded in 1926, and referred to a piece of music that had popular appeal. Over time, the term "pop music" has evolved to encompass a wide range of styles and genres, including rock, pop-rock, pop-punk, and electronic dance music.

So, to answer your question, the term "pop music" comes from the combination of the words "popular" and "music," and was originally used in the mid-20th century to describe music that was popular among the general public, particularly among teenagers.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.125, 0.228, 0.615] Agent refined response: Yes, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is mentioned in the United States Declaration of Independence, which is a document adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The Declaration states that these rights are unalienable, meaning they cannot be taken away or given up, and that they are among the fundamental rights that all human beings are entitled to.



However, the Declaration of Independence is not a part of the United States Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land in the United States. The Constitution does not explicitly mention the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness," but it does contain provisions that protect individual rights and freedoms, such as the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and religion, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law.





In summary, while the phrase "life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness" is not in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, which predates the Constitution, sets forth these fundamental rights as the basis for the United States government and its relationship with its citizens.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.000, 0.181, 0.539] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided earlier, the hormones of the anteriorpituitary gland are created through the following process:

1. Stress induces the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from the hypthalamus.
2. CRH and vasopressin activate the release of adrenocorticoctic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitarygland.

3. ACTH acts on the adrenal cortexto produce glucocorticoids, such as cortisol.

4. These glucocorticoids actback on the anterior pituitarygand and the hypothalamus withnegative feedback to slow the production of CRH.

Therefore, the hormones of the anteriortypuital gland are created through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is a complex neuroendocrine system that involves the interaction of multiple hormones and organs.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.000, 0.174, 0.606] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, secretory cells of endocrine Glands secrete their products through the following mechanisms:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, including enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin. Examples include Brunner's glands, esaphageal glands, and plyoric glands.
3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucus. Examples include the salivary glands, although the parotid gland is predominantly serous.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.026, 0.169, 0.581] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss due to a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. It is caused by the presence of the androgen receptor gene, which is inherited from one's parents. As men age, the levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in their bodies increase, leading to hair loss. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in the hair follicles. Over time, the hair follicles are shrunk, leading to a gradual reduction in hair growth and eventual baldness.

Other factors that can contribute to male pattern baldness include:

* Genetics: A family history of male pattern baldness increases the risk of developing the condition.
* Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormone levels, such as an excess of DHT, can contribute to hair loss.

* Stress: Prolonged periods of stress can lead to an increase in the production of cortisol, a hormone that can contribute to hair loss.
* Poor diet: A diet lacking in essential nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and biotin, can contribute to hair loss.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.000, 0.237, 0.578] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, cones are located in the following areas of the eye:

* The fovea: Cones are greatly outnumbered by rods in most parts of the Retina, but they are much more numerous in the fovea.
* The fovea is a small, specialized area in the center of the retina that is responsible for high-acuity vision.

So, the cones in the eye are primarily located in the fovea.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.130, 0.258, 0.644] Agent refined response: Connective tissue is found throughout the body, including in the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which are the three outer membranes that envelop the brain and spine, are composed of connective tissue and provide support and protection to the brain and spinal cord. Connective tissue is also found in other parts of the body, such as:

* Blood vessels: Connective tissue surrounds and supports blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries.
* Lymphatic system: Connective tissue forms the walls of lymph vessels and lymph nodes, and supports the immune system.
* Muscles: Connective tissue attaches muscles to bones and other structures, and provides support and stability to the musculoskeletal system.
* Bones: Connective tissue forms the bone matrix, which provides structural support and protection to the bone.
* Tendons and ligaments: Connective tissue connects muscles to bones and other tissues, and provides support and stability to joints.
* Aponeuroses: Connective tissue forms the membranes that support and separate muscles, and provide a framework for the musculoskeletal structure.
* Cornea: Connective tissue forms the cornea, the clear outer layer of the eye.
* Organs: Connective tissue supports and connects organs in the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and spleen.

In summary, connective tissue is found throughout the human body, and plays a crucial role in supporting and connecting various structures and organs, as well as providing protection and support to the nervous system.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.
[0.000, 0.183, 0.529] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the religion in the Virginia Colony during the 18th century was primarily Anglican, also known as Episcopalian. However, after the American Revolution, many Anglican clergy and loyalists went into exile, and the local vestry no longer distributed funds or had local government functions such as providing poor relief.

In 1790, the Right Reverend James Madison, a cousin of Patriot James Madison, was appointed as the first Episcopal Bishop of Virginia, and he slowly rebuilt the denomiation within the framework of freedom of choice of belief and worship (see also Virginia Portal and History of Religion in the United States).

The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck.

It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.000, 0.165, 0.497] Agent refined response: In addition to also appearing in several other contexts, the number also appears in textbooks to signify "three" but not, as in the United States, in conjunction with "thousand"; this is because three is the first digit to appear more than once in a number in the English language. This is a more recent development in the 20th century; in the 19th century, the third digit (3) was not a number to be used in place of a thousand. This is why in 1950s England there is a famous comic strip called The Three Musketeers. In the United States, the number three is not used in this way.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.000, 0.211, 0.551] Agent refined response: That was a great start. The Islamic religion was founded by a single person. This person was Muhammad, also known as the Prophet Muhammad. The Quran and Hadith were also created by him. The Quran was the first of the Islamic scriptures to be revealed to him. The Hadith was compiled over a period of 200 years after his death. The Sunnah, the way of life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, forms the basis of the Shia and Sunni schools of Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is also the founder of the Ummah (the global Islamic community), the leader of the Muslim Ummah, and the founder of the city of Medina.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.000, 0.131, 0.538] Agent refined response: As an infinite series may be defined as a limit of a function, an infinite series may not converge. As such, the limit of a function (e.g. a function (x → 0) → 0) does not exist, if the function does not converge. A function may not converge if it has a divergent infinite series (e.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯ (infinite)) as a Taylor series. It may also not converge if the function does not have a Taylor series (e.g. the Cantor function). A function may also not have a limit if it has a discontinuity (e.g. the function (x → 0) has a discontinuity at x = 0).

Prompt: what does the sun represent on the uruguay flag
Ground truth: The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay, based on the U.S flag, where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance. The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santillán, the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti, the sun god of the Inca religion. It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia.
[0.063, 0.288, 0.615] Agent refined response: According to the flag of Uruguay; the sun from the center of the flag represents the national motto of Uruguay; May the sun of independence never set over the homeland.

Prompt: when did beryl markham fly across the atlantic
Ground truth: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.
[0.061, 0.234, 0.608] Agent refined response: Because of her early death, Markham never achieved her ambition of flying solo across the Atlantic. She made a non-stop east-west flight from Darwin to Karachi, on a 1936 Percival Vega, and made a non-stop flight from Nairobi to Cairo on a 1939 de Havilland Gypsy Moth (the first woman to make the journey). Markham also made the first solo transcontinental flight from east to west across Africa. She also set the first woman-only record for solo flight across the Atlantic from east to west. Markham was the first woman to be granted the Alamein Flying Cup.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.061, 0.296, 0.633] Agent refined response: A round roast is a cut of beef from the hindquarters, "eye" of the round is the section of the animal from the "eye" muscle (the muscle in the head), including the eye itself, and is a lean cut of meat. When cooked, it is tender and flavorful with a roast-like texture. Eye of round is a lesser-quality cut of beef and is often discarded. It is sometimes ground or used in stews or slow cooking. When roasted, it is more tender and flavorful than ground beef. It is not a popular cut of meat and is often less expensive.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.000, 0.214, 0.620] Agent refined response: Bullets usually fall back to the ground unless they are spinning at the right angle to be captured by the Earth rotation so that they can be fired again. When fired at a high velocity, the bullet can penetrate the atmosphere, it will lose its forward motion, and its trajectory will be affected by the air resistance it encounters. As the bullet is heavier than air it will be subject to a downward motion and the air resistance will cause it to spin and lose its forward motion. It is impossible to predict the exact path of a bullet fired in the air as its trajectory is influenced by many factors and varies greatly depending upon the projectile and the environment.

Prompt: where does the saying keeping up with the jones come from
Ground truth: The phrase originates with the comic strip Keeping Up with the Joneses, created by Arthur R. "Pop" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in The New York World and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title.

The phrase "keeping up with the Joneses" originally referred to the anxiety of those in the lower classes who wanted to emulate the perceived higher status of the Joneses. The phrase evolved into the modern idiom "keeping up with the Jones" in the mid-20th century.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.000, 0.198, 0.566] Agent refined response: Pop has its roots in various forms of popular music, but has sometimes been used as a catch-all term for popular music, sometimes implying a lack of seriousness or artistic depth. The term has often been associated with "light" (rather than "serious") music, and has sometimes been used as a synonym for "popular music". In the 1950s, some musicologists described the style as "light" music, contrasting it with what they described as "serious" or "art" music, while others described the style as "popular music", contrasting it with what they described, in the 1970s, as "rock music".

Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.122, 0.278, 0.606] Agent refined response: Yes, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, is a phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence, and is a common law right, not a constitutional right. The phrase "life, liberty and the pursuit of happyness" is a reference to the idea of "property in one's self". This phrase is the central idea in the concept of individual rights, and is mentioned in the United States Declaration of Sentiments, which is the source of the phrase. The phrase is used in the United States Declaration of independence to describe the rights which are "self-evident" and "unalienable".

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.047, 0.250, 0.582] Agent refined response: Humans, with the exception of the pineal gland, have a monophasic anterior pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary gland secretes hormones from the hypothalamus (hypophysis), with the hypothalamus containing the neurohypophysis (vasopressin and oxytocin), the pars intermedia (prolactin) and the pars anterior (TSH, FSH, LH and ACTH). These hormones have a variety of functions, including regulation of metabolism, reproductive cycle, growth and development, and the immune system. The hypothalamus has two main parts, the ventromedial nucleus (VMN) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which produce the hormones of the anterior lobe (TSH, FSH, and LH) which regulate the thyroid, gonads and adrenal glands.

Ground truth: The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution.

This principle was enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison and by it the Court established a broad implication of the doctrine of States rights, as well as a limitation of the power of the federal government. This doctrine had been anticipated by the U.S. Constitution itself, by its provisions for a system of federal government, as well as by its republican character.

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.057, 0.204, 0.620] Agent refined response: In 1773 the British Parliament passed the Tea Act because it gave the British East India Company a monopoly on all tea in the American colonies, which was not only a tax but also a trade restriction, and did not allow other importers to sell tea in the colonies. The colonists, who had previously been accustomed to buying tea smuggled in from other ports, were resistant to paying taxes to the British government, and saw the Tea Act as yet another example of taxation without representation.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.
[0.096, 0.245, 0.601] Agent refined response: No later than March 15 would be the time to beware of the Ides of March. Julius Caesar, who would be assassinated on that day, said "Et tu, Brute?", to Brutus, the man who struck him down, as he was on his way to the Senate, where he was killed by a group of senators who had planned the assassination. This phrase has become a famous historical quote, and the day is widely known as "March 15". This is the origin of the phrase "Beware of the Ides of March". The phrase is a warning that Caesar had given to Brutus, which he used as a way of saying "be careful of what you wish for".

The tallest building in Las Vegas is The Drew Las Vegas, which rises 735 feet (224 m) and was topped out in November 2008. This building, however, is currently on hold. The tallest completed building in the city is the 52-story Palazzo, which rises 642 feet (196 m) and was completed in 2007.
[0.097, 0.266, 0.642] Agent refined response: The Strat was topped out on November 18, 2000, and is currently 1,149 feet (350 m) tall. However, the height of the Strat was increased to 1,150 feet (350 m) in 2002, making it the tallest building in Las Vegas. The Strat was the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere until the completion of One World Trade Center in New York City in November 2014. The Strat was designed by architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) and was the tallest building in the world when the project was announced in 1998.

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.
[0.000, 0.219, 0.579] Agent refined response: and the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Columbus sailed the Caribbean and the Golf of Mexico in 1492 and 1493, and on his third voyage, in 1498, he explored the waters of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola. In 1493, he named the Bahamas for the pink shells called conch shells that were abundant on the islands. The first landfall of Columbus in the New World was on the north coast of Haiti, on the island of Hispaniola.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.000, 0.118, 0.496] Agent refined response: Both maternal and paternal genetics are important. Although hair loss can be inherited, it is not a guarantee that someone will lose their hair if they have a family history of baldness. (See also androgenetic alopecia.) Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a genetic disorder in which the body produces androgens (male hormones) that cause hair follicles to shrink and stop producing hair. This condition has been associated with X-linked inheritance and autosomal dominant inheritance. In X-linked inheritance, the gene is located on the X chromosome and has been identified as AR (androgen receptor) and also has been linked to mutations in the androgen receptor gene. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been linked to mutations in androgen receptor gene, X chromosome and androgen receptor gene.

Prompt: who represents the insured in the investigation of a claim
Ground truth: Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.
[0.067, 0.229, 0.591] Agent refined response: adjuster or investigator hired by the insurer, after the policyholder has filed a claim. The investigator will gather information and evidence to support the claim and determine the extent of the loss or damage. The insurer may send an adjuster to the scene of the loss or accident, which is the location of the loss or damage, to assess the extent of the damage and to determine the cost of repairs or replacement. If the loss or damage occurred in a vehicle, the adjuster may inspect the vehicle and review any relevant documentation, such as the police report, to determine the extent of the damage.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.
[0.000, 0.178, 0.539] Agent refined response: Common weapons and armor were often ornamented with a hilt or scabbard. The scabbard was often decorated with skulls and crossbones. A 16th-century work (1560) depicts the Grim Reaper carrying a scythe with a plain wooden handle. In 17th-century prints, the Grim Reaper is often depicted carrying a scythe with a curved blade and a decorated handle. The scythe was a symbol of death and rebirth in ancient Egypt. It was the most common weapon of the Grim Reaper. A scythe with a curved handle was the weapon of choice of the Grim Reaper in ancient Egypt.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.000, 0.178, 0.561] Agent refined response: The timing of diebacks can vary. The causes may be immediate or delayed. A dieback may occur in a single year or over several years. A dieback is usually only noticeable after its onset and is not always predictable. There are several factors that can cause a dieback, such as extreme weather events or the lack of water. The rate of dieback is determined by the severity of the drought and the individual plant's ability to survive. A dieback can occur in any plant and can be caused by a variety of factors. The plant's ability to survive is affected by its genetic makeup and its environment.

Prompt: what's the difference between salisbury steak and hamburger steak
Ground truth: Salisbury steak is a dish made from a blend of ground beef and other ingredients and is usually served with gravy or brown sauce. Hamburg steak is a similar product but differs in ingredients.
[0.000, 0.165, 0.509] Agent refined response: Only 1 / 3 of steaks are formed into patties, and the size and thickness of the patty may vary, but the salisbury steak is thicker than the hamburger steak. A steak patty is usually 1 / 4 inch thick, and the size of the patty is not a factor in the cooking time. The thickness of the patty is important in the cooking time, and a thicker patty (which is more than 1 / 4 inch) will take longer to cook. A salisbury steak is thinner than a hamburger steak, and is often cut into a thickness of 1 / 4 inch.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.138, 0.337, 0.609] Agent refined response: The meninges are the protective membranes of the central nervous system (CNS). The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges. The meninges are composed of the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The dura mater is the outermost meningeal layer (also called the tough, fibrous meningeal layer). The arachnoid mater is the middle meningeal layer (also called arachnoid membrane). The pia mater is the innermost meningeal layer (also called pial membrane). The pia mater is also called the pial membrane. The pia mater is a thin, delicate membrane of the brain, adhering closely to the surface of the brain. The arachnoid mater is a thin, vascular membrane of the brain.

Prompt: when did the nba add the three point line
Ground truth: In the 1979--80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.
[0.000, 0.190, 0.532] Agent refined response: 1. Three-point line (American basketball) Three-point line (also three-point arc) was first used in the 1954 (American) National Basketball League (NBL) game between the Fort Wayne Pipers and the Rochester Royals as a way to create a faster game. The three-point line was introduced as a means to make the game more exciting, as the score was becoming too lopsided. The line was not in the rulebook, but was drawn by the scorer in the middle of the court. The Pipers won the game 92--82, but the three-point line was not used again until 1967.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.000, 0.197, 0.598] Agent refined response: Cones, like most other photoreceptors, are concentrated in the central retina, where visual acuity is highest, but are fewer in the periphery. The distribution of cones varies by species, with the highest density in the fovea, where the cones are arranged in a mosaic. They are most numerous at the center of the retina, where they are densely packed. They are typically found at the back of the eye, opposite the lens. The cones are most numerous at the center of vision and are arranged in a mosaic pattern. The central 10 degrees of the visual field is where most of the cones are located.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.127, 0.337, 0.665] Agent refined response: Including the nervous system, connective tissue can be found in the body. In the nervous system, connective cells are the main component of the meninges and the myelin sheath. The meninges are membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. They are composed of connective tissue and include the dura mater (the outermost membrane), the arachnoid mater (the middle membrane), and the pia mater (the innermost membrane). The meninges contain nerve fibers and produce cerebrospinal fluid. They include blood vessels and nerve fibers. The meninges help protect the brain and spinal cord and facilitate their growth.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.048, 0.237, 0.587] Agent refined response: Before birth (gestation), the heart initially forms from two tube -like structures, called the first and second heart tubes. This begins at approximately 2 weeks (14 days) of gestation with a fusion of the first and second heart tubes forming the primitive heart tube. The first heart tube forms from the forerunbs and the second from the hindbrain. The first heart tube forms the left ventricle and left atrium, and the second forms the right ventricle and right atrium. The right ventricle and right atria are derived from the third and fourth arches, and the left ventricle and left auricle, from the fourth and fifth arches.

Prompt: where does decussation occur in the spinothalamic pathway
Ground truth: The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.
[0.103, 0.343, 0.699] Agent refined response: Spinal cord neurons send axons to the contralateral (opposite) side of the body via the decussation of the posterior white commissure, the anterior white commissure and the anterior commissure of the medulla oblongata (the latter via the cranial nerves). Thus, the decussation of the posterior commissure results in the cross-over of the ascending spinothalamic tracts, while the decussation of the anterior commissure results in the cross over of the descending spinothalamic tract. Decussation typically occurs in the ventral white matter of the spinal cord. Decussation is the only area of cross-over in the spinal cord.

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison. The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution, which replaced hanging. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling declaring existing capital punishment statutes unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972), New York was without a death penalty until 1995, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a new statute into law, which provided for execution by lethal injection.
[0.000, 0.262, 0.648] Agent refined response: The state of New York abolished the death penalty, as a means of punishment, in 1977. The first New York execution by electrocution took place in 1890, and the last occurred in 1977. To further emphasize the state of New York as being "death penalty-free", a moratorium on executions was imposed in 1972, leading to the eventual abolition of the death penalty. In 1977, New York State enacted a new law, repealing the death penalty. As of 2007, the New York State Legislature has not re-enacted the death penalty.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.

The church was also responsible for administering the oath of allegiance and enforcing the oath of abjuration of the English monarch (in 1677). In 1619, the Church of England had been established in the colony and had authority over the religious affairs of the colony (and the colonists).

Prompt: when was the biltmore house opened to the public
Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism. Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.

In 1942, the estate was taken over by the United States government to serve as a temporary military hospital during World War II.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.000, 0.176, 0.519] Agent refined response: That was a huge success. There was a debate as to whether the Quran was the word of God or the word of Muhammad. This was also the beginning of the Islamic Golden Age. The Arabian Peninsula had been a crossroads of trade and religion since the ancient period. The Islamic conquests of the Sassanid Empire and the Byzantine Empire (also known as the Eastern Roman Empire) continued under the Rashidun Caliphate (632--661 CE), with the Islamic conquest of Persia (633--651 CE) and the Islamic conquest of Syria (634--669 CE) being considered the most significant. The conquests were also marked by the Islamic conquest of Egypt (641 CE) and the Islamic invasion of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey).

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words").

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.067, 0.168, 0.578] Agent refined response: As regards as an infinite series, a limit may not exist if the series does not converge, i.e. the series goes on indefinitely (i.e., an infinite number of terms). An example of a function that does not have a limit is f (x) =  1 / (1 + x), as the function can be made as large as one likes by taking x large enough (i.e., the function can be made as large (in absolute value) as one likes). The limit of the function as x approaches infinity is 0, but it does not exist. It is also possible to have a function (e.g. f (x) = x) where the limit of the function does not exist at a single point (i.e. the function does not have a limit at any point).

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

This cut is also known as a "butler steak" or "rump steak" in some countries, and is leaner than the more tender and flavorful "eye of the loin" cut.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.000, 0.172, 0.606] Agent refined response: Bullets usually lose most of their velocity when fired at sea level because the air resistance they encounter can only push them downward with a force equal to their weight. If the bullet is fired at a steep angle, it will penetrate the atmosphere at a higher velocity, before it begins to lose its velocity, so the bullet can travel long distances in the atmosphere and its trajectory is influenced by the air resistance and the angle of its trajectory. The bullet can be damaged by the friction with the air and its trajectory is influenced by its mass and shape. Bullets are designed to be aerodynamic and are made of materials that can withstand the heat generated by the friction with the air.

Prompt: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany
Ground truth: Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould. Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

Prompt: when did the right to buy scheme start
Ground truth: After Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979, the legislation to implement the Right to Buy was passed in the Housing Act 1980. Michael Heseltine, in his role as Secretary of State for the Environment, was in charge of implementing the legislation. Some 6,000,000 people were affected; about one in three actually purchased their housing unit. Heseltine noted that "no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people". He said the right to buy had two main objectives: to give people what they wanted, and to reverse the trend of ever-increasing dominance of the state over the life of the individual.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.053, 0.230, 0.589] Agent refined response: Trigger points or painful spots. also known as "tender points" or "Trigger points", are areas of taut muscle tissue that also contain a "spindle" of muscle fibers. These spindles are also known as "myofascial trigger points" and can cause pain, stiffness, numbness, or weakness in muscles and connective tissue. Other trigger points may be located along nerves or their branches (peripheral nerves) or within the spinal cord and brain (central nervous system). Trigger points can cause pain that radiates to other areas of the body and may be associated with muscle spasms and limited range of motion.

Ground truth: Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province. It was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in 1867. Isma'il Pasha and Tewfik Pasha governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty until the British occupation of 1882. Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867--1914) remained a de jure Ottoman province until 5 November 1914, when it was declared a British protectorate in reaction to the decision of the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.040, 0.218, 0.563] Agent refined response: Pop has its roots in a number of different styles of music, including early forms of rock and roll, doo-wop, and Motown, and sometimes includes catchy hooks and/or riffs. Some of the most popular pop music today (often termed "pop-rock") has roots in the rock and roll of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Some have argued that the term "pop" has come to refer to a more general trend of popular music, rather than a particular genre, with some genres such as hip-hop and electronic dance music having become the most popular forms of music in the 21st century.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".

The United States Declaration of Independence is a statement of political philosophy which describes the rights and principles that the Thirteen Colonies in North America stated to be the reason for seeking independence from Great Britain. The Declaration has had a profound impact upon political philosophy, and is a key document in the history of democracy.

Prompt: when did equus first appear in fossil record
Ground truth: The first Old World equid fossil was found in the gypsum quarries in Montmartre, Paris, in the 1820s. The tooth was sent to the Paris Conservatory, where it was identified by Georges Cuvier, who identified it as a browsing equine related to the tapir. His sketch of the entire animal matched later skeletons found at the site.
[0.000, 0.177, 0.494] Agent refined response: Equus, having its origin around 45 million years ago, was not yet present in the fossil record. It was therefore not until  around 30 million years ago, during the late Miocene, that the first Equus fossils were found. The first known Equus, a species known as Equus quagga, was found in Africa (the name is derived from the Zulu word for zebra). Equus was once thought to be a distinct genus; however, it is now considered to be a subgenus of the genus Equus (E. quagga is now the earliest known member of the Equus genus). All Equus species are now extinct. Equus simus (the zebra) and Equus caballus (the wild ass) are both thought to have originated around 2.5 million years ago.

Prompt: sending money home to the native country is an example of
Ground truth: A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker to an individual in his or her home country. Money sent home by migrants competes with international aid as one of the largest financial inflows to developing countries. Workers' remittances are a significant part of international capital flows, especially with regard to labour-exporting countries. In 2014, $436 billion went to developing countries, setting a new record. Overall global remittances totaled $582 billion in 2015. Some countries, such as India and China, receive tens of billions of US dollars in remittances each year from their expatriates and diaspora.

Remittances are in contrast to international aid, such as foreign aid from governments and other organizations. Remittances from diaspora communities are one of the largest contributors to foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries. In 21 countries, remittances from diaspora exceeded the total amount of foreign direct investment in 2013. Remittances are widely used as a means of transferring funds from migrant workers to their families.

Prompt: who was charlie writing to in perks of being a wallflower movie
Ground truth: The story begins with a quiet, sensitive 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters about his life to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that person because he said that he heard the person was nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.
[0.000, 0.135, 0.477] Agent refined response: That which they say in the book (which I heard) is that it was meant to be a letter. It was meant to be read by "Friend" which Charlie never specified. This was a recurring theme throughout the book: the inability to communicate (and, therefore, to express himself). He was going to write it ("The letter") on a "piece of paper", as he states in the book, "and put it in a corner for someone to find." For Charlie, the letter itself has a special significance because it has the potential to change the way he feels about himself. Charlie's writing style is a major aspect of the book, and he often uses the imagery of letters to explore his feelings.

Ground truth: Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.
[0.039, 0.166, 0.509] Agent refined response: As a whooping cough vaccine that was effective against pertussis became widely available in the 1940s, but the vaccine did not completely eliminate the disease. Before the introduction of the pertussis vaccine in the 1940 s there were some attempts at vaccine development. In the early 20th century researchers used various animal-derived pertussis vaccines but these were not effective against human pertussis. In the 1930s scientists were able to isolate the pertussis toxin from Bordetella pertussis and began developing a vaccine that used the toxin to stimulate an immune response. An early vaccine developed by Dr. Albert Sabin was tested in the 1940.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.000, 0.182, 0.564] Agent refined response: Developing, maintaining pituitary function is critical for overall body homeostasis. The anterior pituitary gland is responsible for secreting hormones in response to hypothalamic signals. This hormone secretion regulates a wide range of bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. The anterior pituitary secretes these hormones in response to the hypothalamus's signals. The hypothalamus acts as a regulator of hormone secretion by secreting hormones (such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormine) which in turn stimulate the anterior pituitary to release the appropriate hormones. The anterior pituitary has a high concentration of cells with a specific pattern of gene expression. The gene expression pattern of these cells is established during development and is maintained through cellular differentiation.

Prompt: to whom do the powers not given to the federal government by the constitution go
Ground truth: The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people.
[0.000, 0.254, 0.602] Agent refined response: By the U.S. Constitution it is the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Constitution was divided into three branches of government: the legislative, executive and judicial. The Constitution provides that each branch of government was to be separate and independent of the others. This was intended to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful. It was to provide a check and balance upon the power of the others. It also defined the powers and duties of each branch. The powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution (Article I, Section 8) are the powers of the states and the people. This also applies to the powers not delegated to the states by the Constitution. It also applies to the powers not prohibited to the people by the Constitution.

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: who came up with the first working periodic table
Ground truth: The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties. The most important event in its history occurred in 1869, when the table was published by Dmitri Mendeleev, who built upon earlier discoveries by scientists such as Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier and John Newlands, but who is nevertheless generally given sole credit for its development.
[0.038, 0.199, 0.571] Agent refined response: The limitations of the early table proved a significant problem in the field of chemistry. A number of attempts were made to create a table which better reflected the chemical elements known at the time, but none of these were successful. In 1863, its most influential chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev, who had been trying to organize all known chemical elements into a coherent table for over a decade, finally succeeded. Mendeleev was assisted by his brother Ivan who helped him compile his table. His work laid foundation for modern chemistry. Mendeleev published his table in 1869. However his table was not complete until 1871 when he included all 66 known elements. His table contained all known elements until 1919.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.069, 0.217, 0.617] Agent refined response: In 1773 the British Parliament passed the Tea Act because it wanted to help its "loaned" colonies in America pay their debts to British merchants, and it wanted to ensure that the colonies would not be able to trade freely with other countries. The British government had long held the right to tax the colonies, but it had not previously taxed the tea they imported. The Tea Act, however, imposed a tax on all tea consumed in the colonies, and it allowed the only authorized importer of tea to be the British East India Company, which was a monopoly and had been the main importer of tea to the colonies.

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).
[0.000, 0.196, 0.593] Agent refined response: The construction of the pyramid by the pharaoh Khufu also led to a series of architectural innovations. Its base,  with a perimeter of about 1,000 meters, is a square of 230 meters side, with a height of  481 meters. The pyramid took approximately 20 years to build, and required the work of 100,000 workers, mostly skilled craftsmen, engineers, and laborers. The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for the pharaoh Khufu, was the largest of the pyramids. It contains an estimated 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.000, 0.166, 0.640] Agent refined response: Secretory cells--endocrine cells--secrete their products into bloodstreams, rather than urine. The products of endocrine cells are chemical messengers that help regulate various physiological processes. The secretory cells secrete their products into the bloodstreams that are close to the endocrine glands. The hormones secreted by the endocrine cells pass through the bloodstreams to the target cells, where they bind to the receptors. The hormones include thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine), insulin, growth hormone, oxytocin, prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The endocrine cells include thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, adrenal gland, pancreas, pituitary gland, and ovary.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.
[0.064, 0.235, 0.598] Agent refined response: Brutus would later use this phrase to Caesar before he stabbed him. This would later be referenced in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, which ends with the famous line "Et tu, Brute?", meaning "And you, Brutus?", to show that Brutus had betrayed Caesar. As the ides of March is the day of Caesar's assassination, this phrase is often used to reference the idea of "betrayal" or "murder". This phrase is not a direct quote, but is a reference to the original "Beware the Ides of March", which is a famous phrase in history. This phrase was not said by Caesar; the actual line is "Beware the Ides Of March".

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.
[0.000, 0.230, 0.569] Agent refined response: and Columbus and his crew and the Spanish and Portuguese explorers and colonizers. The Spanish and Portuguese first explored the waters and lands of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola, and by 1493, the Spanish had established settlements on the island of Hispaniola, and by the 1520s, the Spanish had established an empire in the Caribbean. The Spanish later explored the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Strait of Florida. This was later confirmed by Ponce de Leon's voyage to Florida in 1513.

Prompt: who represents the insured in the investigation of a claim
Ground truth: Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.
[0.000, 0.176, 0.566] Agent refined response: After reviewing the policy, it should be filed within 30 days of the occurrence or after the policyholder has suffered a loss. The policyholder or the insured (or the insured's representative) should be present at the investigation, which is conducted by the insurance company. Insurers may not investigate claims themselves, and they may use the services of a public insurance adjuster, who is an independent contractor hired by the insurer to represent the insured's interests in the claims process. If the insurer does not use a public adjuster, the insured may not have the opportunity to select an adjuster of their choice, which may be an advocate for the insured.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.
[0.000, 0.170, 0.545] Agent refined response: Common people and religious figures often depicted the Grim Reaper or Death with a scythe or a sickle. The sickle was a popular agricultural tool in the Middle Ages (12th--15th centuries). It was often carried by peasants and farmers. The scythe, however, was a more specialized tool that cuts crops with a curved blade. According to folklore, the Grim Reaper's scythe was made of black iron, forged from the swords of fallen knights. The blade was so sharp that it could cut through armor and metal. The scythe's handle was often made of wood, bone, or ivory.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.000, 0.160, 0.525] Agent refined response: Both parents. It is one of the most common inherited conditions. Although it has been thought, in the past, that this condition is more common in men than women, there are many women who have a similar condition. In these cases, hair loss may be similar to that seen in men with male pattern baldness (alopecia areata). In these cases, hair loss is usually patchy and limited to one area of the scalp. In women, hair loss may be patchy and limited to one area (alopecia areata) or more widespread and similar to male pattern baldness (female pattern baldness). The condition has been linked to a number of genes and genetic variations, including androgen receptor gene (AR), hormone receptor gene (HR), hormone-sensitive gene (H) and HLH (Hair Loss Hormone). Hair loss in women is also associated with certain hormonal imbalances, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Prompt: what's the difference between salisbury steak and hamburger steak
Ground truth: Salisbury steak is a dish made from a blend of ground beef and other ingredients and is usually served with gravy or brown sauce. Hamburg steak is a similar product but differs in ingredients.
[0.000, 0.229, 0.602] Agent refined response: Only a few inches, but very large in taste and texture, and the quality of the meat can vary greatly between the two. Salisbury steak is more common in canned or frozen forms, and is made with leaner cuts of meat. The meat is ground, and then formed into a patty. The "sausage" is not cooked in a casing, and is often served with a gravy. The quality of the meat is not necessarily higher than that of hamburger steak, and the meat is often not as well-formed. The resulting product is more like a meatloaf.
================================================================================
Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.000, 0.209, 0.581] Agent refined response: Dieback means the process of the decline. In some cases, a species ' population may be reduced by a significant amount, or even extirpated. The mechanism is thought to be a result of environmental stress and genetic drift. A population crash can occur when the number of individuals in a population declines rapidly and often to the point of extinction. The reasons are usually natural and can be due to the species ' ability to adapt to its environment and the result of competition and predation. The decline can be caused by factors such as habitat destruction or fragmentation and overhunting. A population crash can occur in a single generation or may be a result of a long-term decline.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.148, 0.284, 0.572] Agent refined response: The three layers of the meninges are the dura mater (outermost), arachnoid mater (middle) and pia mater (innermost). The dura mater is a tough, leathery membrane of collagen and elastin. The arachnoid mater is a thin, vascular membrane of collagen and elastic fibers. The pia mater is a delicate, vascular membrane of the brain and spinal cord. The meninges are responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord, and are involved in the exchange of nutrients and waste products. In the case of meningitis, the meninges become inflamed, which can cause fever, headache, and the sensitivity to light.

Prompt: when did the nba add the three point line
Ground truth: In the 1979--80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.
[0.071, 0.224, 0.559] Agent refined response: 1. Three-point line (also three-point shot) 3 (American basketball) three-point line (also three- point shot) 3.1 (British basketball) was a line at a maximum of 23 feet 9 inches from the basket and was introduced in the 1979--80 season as a way to encourage more scoring from outside the three-point line. It was not a rule until the 1980--81 season, when it was made a part of the NBA Official Rules. The line was 25 feet (7.62 m) from the basket in the 1977--78 season.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.000, 0.174, 0.578] Agent refined response: Cones, like most other photoreceptors, are distributed across the retina, but are most numerous in the central part, where the visual acuity is highest. They have a characteristic bipolar shape, with two cell bodies located at the retinal pigment epithelium. Because of their position, cones are able to detect light more efficiently than rods, whereas rods are more sensitive to low light levels. It is believed that the rod cells are able to sense the direction of the light, whereas the cone cells are able to sense the color of the light.

Prompt: where do pineapples come from in the world
Ground truth: Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in five to ten months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest. In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
[0.069, 0.187, 0.557] Agent refined response: Pineapples originate, the Caribbean Islands. The first pineapple fruit is believed to have been cultivated in South America and the Caribbean: Christopher Columbus brought pineapple to Europe and also introduced it to the West Indies and South America in 1493, and it was brought to the Philippines by Spanish conquistadors in 1521. The pineapple was also brought to Hawaii in 1813 by Polynesian people who migrated to the islands. It was also introduced to Africa in the 19th century. Pineapples are now grown in tropical and subtropical countries around the world, such as Costa Rica, Brazil, and China.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.000, 0.130, 0.532] Agent refined response: Some people celebrate April Fools ' Day by sending text messages and emails on or around 1 April. The "holiday" is often celebrated in other countries on or around 1 April. In some countries their celebrations are very similar to those in the UK. In others (e.g., the United States), the day is not widely observed. The celebrations are usually short, usually lasting only a few minutes, although some people might be fooled for longer periods. The idea is to try to fool people, usually by telling them something which is untrue.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.000, 0.213, 0.612] Agent refined response: In the human body, connective tissue includes the largest tissue group. The main function of connective tissue is to support the body. Connective tissue includes the following: (1) Bone and cartilage. Bone tissue is composed of two types of bone: compact bone and spongy bone. Compact bone is dense and hard (it is the outer portion of bones). Spongy bone is porous and spongy. Bone tissue provides mechanical support, stores calcium, and releases it as needed. Cartilage is a more flexible tissue than bone. There are two types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage and elastic cartilage.

Prompt: name of black man in to kill a mockingbird
Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: what is the approximate volume of the brain
Ground truth: Studies on human brain size, largely based on participants of European ancestry, tend to find an average adult brain volume of 1260 cubic centimeters (cm) for men and 1130 cm for women. There is, however, substantial variation between individuals; one study of 46 adults, aged 22--49 years and of mainly European descent, found an average brain volume of 1273.6 cm for men, with a range of 1052.9 to 1498.5 cm, and 1131.1 cm for women, with a range of 974.9 to 1398.1 cm.
[0.000, 0.162, 0.572] Agent refined response: Human brain studies suggest that adult brains tend to have some very consistent average sizes. For example the human brain has been found to be on average : 1295 cubic centimeters in volume, or about 1. 4 liters. This is notably smaller than the 1500 cubic centimeters of the average human skull, with the cerebral cavity of the brain taking up only about 75 % of the available space. This volume, however, can vary greatly between individuals, with some brains being much larger or smaller than average. There is also evidence that brain size is not the only factor, and that the actual volume of brain tissue is also important.

Prompt: the elements in each period have the same number of
Ground truth: A period in the periodic table is one of the horizontal rows, all of those elements have the same number of electron shells. Going across a period, each element has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. Arranged this way, groups of elements in the same column have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the alkali metals lie in the first column (group 1) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. As of 2016 a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed.

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.
[0.000, 0.219, 0.587] Agent refined response: From the Ancient Maya and Aztecs to the arrival of Europeans. Although chocolate had been enjoyed in Central America for centuries, the first historical references to chocolate in the Americas were by the Aztecs.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.049, 0.244, 0.623] Agent refined response: Before birth (and first heartbeat) and development, the heart initially starts with a tube like structure, called the atrioventricular (first) cavity. This first cavity forms at the junction of the two upper chambers (atria) and the two lower chambers (ventricles). The atrioventricular cavity develops from the fusion of two endocardial tubes that are connected to the primordial atria and ventricles. The first heartbeat and contraction of the heart occurs at approximately 4 weeks of gestation, and the heart begins to pump blood and establishes the cardiac loop, which connects the atria and ventricles.

Prompt: where does decussation occur in the spinothalamic pathway
Ground truth: The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.
[0.122, 0.356, 0.652] Agent refined response: Spinal cord neurons send the axons (the part of the neuron cell body that carries the axon) to the opposite side of the body via the dorsal (back) white matter tracts, in order to form the crossed descending tracts of the spinothalamic pathways. The axons of the cell bodies of the neurons in the lateral gray matter of the spinal cord, in contrast, form the uncrossed ascending tracts of the spinothelamic pathway. The decussation of the cord typically occurs around the 10th--14th day of embryonic development. The decussation of the spinal cord refers to the crossing of the ventral (front) white matter tracts of the spinal cord.

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison. The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution, which replaced hanging. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling declaring existing capital punishment statutes unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972), New York was without a death penalty until 1995, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a new statute into law, which provided for execution by lethal injection.
[0.000, 0.265, 0.644] Agent refined response: The state of New York, as the last state to use the electric chair in the United States, discontinued the practice in 2007. In 1972, the state Legislature mandated the use of lethal injection as the primary method of execution. As of 2007, the state had conducted 621 executions by electrocution, more than any other state.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.

In 1677, the Anglican Church was established as the official state church of the colony (Virginia was the first colony to establish a state church).
