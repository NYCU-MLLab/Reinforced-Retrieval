Ground truth: The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to outer space, are Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes\; the Invisible Girl (Susan `` Sue '' Storm\; later `` Invisible Woman ''), who eventually married Reed, who can render herself invisible and later project powerful invisible force fields\; the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly\; and the monstrous Thing (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star and Reed's college roommate as well as a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability, and endurance due to the nature of his stone - like flesh.
[0.638, 0.147]Original response:  According to the Marvel Comics universe, the Fantastic Four (Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and the Thing) gained their powers in the following ways:

* Mr. Fantastic (Reed Richards): Reed was exposed to cosmic rays during a space mission, which granted him the ability to stretch and manipulate his body like rubber.
* Invisible Woman (Susan Storm): Susan was exposed to the same cosmic rays as Reed, but instead gained the ability to become invisible and project force fields.
* Human Torch (Johnny Storm): Johnny was also exposed to cosmic rayS, which gave him the ability to control and manipulate fire.
* Thing (Ben Grimm): Ben was exposed to cosmic radiation that transformed him into a being with superhuman strength and durability, as well as a rock-like appearance.

when was the 24 second shot clock introduced [/INST]
Ground truth: The shot clock first came to use in 1954 in Syracuse, New York, where Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers) owner Danny Biasone and general manager Leo Ferris experimented using a 24 - second version during a scrimmage game. According to Biasone, `` I looked at the box scores from the games I enjoyed, games where they did n't screw around and stall. I noticed each team took about 60 shots. That meant 120 shots per game. So I took 2,880 seconds (48 minutes) and divided that by 120 shots. The result was 24 seconds per shot. '' Biasone and Ferris then convinced the NBA to adopt it for the 1954 -- 55 season, a season in which the Nationals won the NBA Championship.
[0.526, 0.000]Original response:  The 24-second shot clock was introduced in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the 1954-1955 season. The shot clock was introduced to speed up the pace of play and to reduce the amount of time teams spent on the court, as well as to create more scoring opportunities. Prior to the introduction of the shot clock, teams had an unlimited amount of time to shoot the ball, which often led to slow-paced and low-scoring games. The 24- second shot clock has remained the standard for professional basketball ever since its introduction.
[0.625, 0.191]Prifix response: The shot clock first came to use in 1954 in Syracuse, New York, where referee Eddie Gottlieb (a former college player and now a National Basketball League official) and Syracuse coach Frank McGuire implemented a 24-second shot clock during a game between Syracuse and Colgate. The team's center, 6-foot-10 center Jim Pollesel, took the shot and scored in 24 seconds. The shot clock was then introduced in the NBA during the 1954--55 season. According to NBA historian John D. Markle, the shot clock was introduced because of a 1954 game between the Minneapolis Lakers and the Rochester Royals in which the Lakers' George Mikan held the ball for 24 seconds and scored. The Lakers won 71--68. Mikan's teammate, Clyde Lovellette, said.

what are constructed waterways that connect natural waterways [/INST]
Ground truth: The Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) is a 3,000 - mile (4,800 km) inland waterway along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, running from Boston, Massachusetts, southward along the Atlantic Seaboard and around the southern tip of Florida, then following the Gulf Coast to Brownsville, Texas. Some sections of the waterway consist of natural inlets, saltwater rivers, bays, and sounds, while others are artificial canals. It provides a navigable route along its length without many of the hazards of travel on the open sea.
[0.476, 0.000]Original response:  Constructed waterways, also known as artificial waterways or man-made waterways, are waterways that are created by humans through engineering and construction techniques. These waterways are designed to connect or alter the natural waterways in a particular area, often for various purposes such as irrigation, drainage, flood control, or navigation.

Some examples of constructed waterways include:

1. Canals: These are artificial waterways that are dug or dredged to connect two natural waterways or to provide a new waterway. Canals are often used for irrigation, dredging, or navigation.
2. Dams: Dams are constructed to impound a natural waterway, creating a reservoir or lake behind the dam. The water level behind the dam can be controlled to provide water for irrigation, drinking water supply, or hydroelectric power generation.
3. Levees: Levees are constructed to prevent flooding by blocking the flow of water into a low-lying area. Levees can be made of earth, concrete, or other materials and are often used to protect cities, agricultural land, or other areas from flooding.

[0.509, 0.000]Prifix response: The Deltaic system (also delta) is a landform along a river, estuary, or coastline, formed by the deposition of sediment carried by a river and the resulting accumulation of deltaic deposits, and the creation of new land along the river. Deltas form where a river meets the sea, and the river deposits sediment carried from the land. Deltas are formed over thousands of years, as the river continues to erode the surrounding landscape and carry sediment downstream. Deltas are characterized by a network of distributaries, levees, and wetlands.

The junction between the embryological foregut and midgut lies just below the major duodenal papilla.
[0.696, 0.140]Original response:  The common bile duct enters the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, near the major duodenal papilla. The common bile duCT is a tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine for the purpose of aiding digestion.

when did tasmanian devils go extinct on the mainland [/INST]
Ground truth: It is believed that ancient marsupials migrated from what is now South America to Australia tens of millions of years ago during the time of Gondwana, and that they evolved as Australia became more arid. Fossils of species similar to modern devils have been found, but it is not known whether they were ancestors of the contemporary species, or whether the current devils co-existed with these species. The date that the Tasmanian devil became locally extinct from the Australian mainland is unclear\; most evidence suggests they had contracted to three relict populations around 3000 years ago. A tooth found in Augusta, Western Australia has been dated to 430 years ago, but archaeologist Oliver Brown disputes this and considers the devil's mainland extinction to have occurred around 3000 years ago.
[0.503, 0.000]Original response:  Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) are found only in Tasmania, Australia, and have never been found on the mainland. Therefore, they have never gone extinct on the mainlands. Tasmanian devils are endemic to Tasmania and are considered to be an iconic and unique species of the island. They are known for their distinctive appearance, with a stocky build, a long snout, and a loud, raspy growl. They are also known for their carnivorous diet and their social behavior, which includes living in small groups called "mobs" and engaging in a complex communication system.
[0.644, 0.071]Prifix response: It is believed that Tasmanian devils are descended from mainland Australian carnivorous marsupials that migrated to Tasmania during the last ice age, and became extinct around 40,000 years ago. They are thought to have been the last of the mainland marsupial predators, and were the only surviving members of the family Mammalia. The last known mainland Tasmanian devils were found in the 1930s, but the species has been extinct since the 1940s. The last known Tasmanian devil was found in 1966, but it is believed that the species may have survived until the 1970s.

why are the tides so extreme in the bay of fundy [/INST]
Ground truth: Traditional Mi'kmaq folklore states that the tides in the Bay of Fundy are caused by a giant whale splashing in the water. Oceanographers attribute it to tidal resonance resulting from a coincidence of timing: the time it takes a large wave to go from the mouth of the bay to the inner shore and back is practically the same as the time from one high tide to the next. During the 12.4 - hour tidal period, 115 billion tonnes of water flow in and out of the bay.
[0.567, 0.083]Original response:  The Bay of Fundy, located between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada, is known for having the highest tidal range in the world. The tidal range in the Bay of Fundy can reach up to 16.3 meters (53.5 feet) at its peak, which is significantly higher than the average tidal range of around 6 meters (20 feet) found in other coastal areas around the world.

There are several reasons why the tides in the Bay of Fundry are so extreme:

1. Geometry: The Bay of Fundy is shaped like a funnel, with the narrowest point located between the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This geometry causes the tides to become more amplified as they flow in and out of the bay.
2. Ocean Currents: The Gulf of Maine, which is located to the north of the Bay of Fundy, has a strong ocean current that flows into the bay. This current helps to push the water in and out of the Bay of Fundly, contributing to the extreme tidal range.
3. Gravity: The gravitational pull of the moon and sun
[0.637, 0.223]Prifix response: Traditional Mi'kmaq stories tell that the tides in the Bay of Fundy are caused by a giant whale named Tessalikh. Tessalikh is said to be a sea monster from the depths of the ocean. He is said to be so large that he can lift the entire island of Grand Banks from one side of the bay to the other. The tides are said to be so extreme because Tessalikh is trying to lift the island from the bottom of the sea.

On a boat, "S/S" typically stands for "Stainless Steel." It is a common abbreviation used in the marine industry to indicate that a particular component or hardware is made of stainless steel.

For example, if you see a boat part labeled as "S/S cleats," it means that the cleats (small metal bars used to secure lines or fenders) are made of stainless Steel.

who is the greatest horse that ever lived [/INST]
Ground truth: Secretariat (March 30, 1970 -- October 4, 1989) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. His record - breaking win in the Belmont Stakes, where he left the field 31 lengths behind him, is widely regarded as one of the greatest races of all time. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. He was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. In the List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Secretariat is second only to Man o ' War (racing career 1919 -- 1920), who also was a large chestnut colt given the nickname `` Big Red ''.
[0.571, 0.061]Original response:  Ah, a question that has been debated for centuries! There have been many great horses throughout history, but if I had to choose the greatest of all time, I would have to go with Secretariat.

Secretariat, also known as "Big Red," was a Thoroughbred racehorse that was born in 1970 and retired in 1973. He is widely considered one of the fastest and most impressive racehorses in history, and his achievements on the track are truly remarkable.

In his three-year racing career, Secretariat won 16 of 21 races, including the Triple Crown in 1972 - a feat that had not been accomplished in 25 years. He won the Kentucky Derby by an incredible 2 1/2 lengths, the Preakness Stakes by 2 1/4 lengths, and the Belmont Stakes by an astonishing 31 lengths, setting a new track record in the process.

what are the estate tax rates for 2018 [/INST]
Ground truth: If an asset is left to a spouse or a federally recognized charity, the tax usually does not apply. In addition, a maximum amount, varying year by year, can be given by an individual, before and / or upon their death, without incurring federal gift or estate taxes: $5,340,000 for estates of persons dying in 2014 and 2015, $5,450,000 (effectively $10.90 million per married couple, assuming the deceased spouse did not leave assets to the surviving spouse) for estates of persons dying in 2016. Because of these exemptions, it is estimated that only the largest 0.2 % of estates in the U.S. will pay the tax. For 2017, the exemption increases to $5.5 million. In 2018, the exemption will double to $11.18 million per taxpayer due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
[0.569, 0.000]Original response:  According to the knowledge I have been trained on, the federal estate tax rates for  twenty 2018 are as follows:

* The estate tax rate is 18% on estates worth more than $11.18 million for individuals and $22.36 million for couples.
* The tax rate jumps to 20% on estates worth between $11.19 million and $22.4 million for individuals and $44.58 million and $89.16 million for couples
* The tax rate is 21% on estates worth over $22.40 million for individuals and $ 44.59 million for couples. 

It is important to note that these rates are subject to change and may vary depending on individual circumstances. It is recommended to consult a tax professional or financial advisor for more detailed information and guidance.
[0.617, 0.072]Prifix response: If an estate is worth more than a certain amount, it is subject to an estate tax. In 2018, the amount, known as the exemption, is $11.18 million, and for 2019, it is $11.4 million, or $22.8 million for married couples. The tax rate for estates worth more than $11.1 million (or $22.8 for married couples) is 40 percent. For estates worth more than the exemption amount, the tax rate increases to 55 percent. For estates that are worth more than $20.5 million, the tax rate is 55 percent. The tax rate for the portion of the estate that exceeds $20.5 M is 55 % for 2017. For 2018 and 2019 the tax rate for the portion that exceeds $22.8 M is 55 %.

who holds the record for the longest field goal [/INST]
Ground truth: The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by Matt Prater on December 8, 2013. The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey and then matched by Jason Elam, Sebastian Janikowski, and David Akers. High school, college and most professional football leagues offer only a three - point field goal\; however, some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four - point field goals. NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules ' Super Goal or basketball's three - point line), a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League. Similarly, the sport of arena football sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points\; it failed, since only one kicker (Brian Mitchell) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency. (In six - man football, where there is no offensive line, all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual three.)
[0.519, 0.004]Original response:  According to the knowledge I have been trained on, the record for the longest Field Goal in NFL history is held by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos, who made a 64-yard field goal against the San Diego Chargers on November 20, 2013.
[0.666, 0.262]Prifix response: The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by Matt Prater on December 8, 2013. The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey in 1969, and then matched by Jason Elam in 1999. However, there are only three field goals of 64 yards or more that have been attempted; one by Matt Prater, one by Sebastian Janikowski, and one by David Akers. Since there have been only three, it is unlikely that anyone will break that record (though it's not impossible) unless a quarterback or kicker is able to complete a 64-yarder with a rare, perfect snap (or one that's even longer) through the opponent's goalposts. Instead, most coaches would rather have their kicker attempt a shorter field goal than risk a miss (or a blocked field goal) on a 64- yarder. (That is, unless they're playing a team that's weak on their kick coverage.)

in 1827 the cherokee tribe of georgia wrote a constitution modeled on what document [/INST]
Ground truth: In 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two - tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son John Ridge. Convinced the tribe's survival required English - speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed John Ross as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the Vermont missionary Samuel Worcester and Major Ridge's nephew Elias Boudinot, who had taken the name of his white benefactor, a leader of the Continental Congress and New Jersey Congressman. They translated the Bible into Cherokee syllabary. Boudinot published the first edition of the bilingual ' Cherokee Phoenix, ' the first American Indian newspaper, in February 1828.
[0.531, 0.000]Original response:  Based on the knowledge provided, the Cherokee Tribe of Georgia wrote a constitution modeled after the United States Constitution in 1827.
[0.584, 0.072]Prifix response: In 1827, the Cherokee Nation adopted a constitution, and a national government with a president and a legislature. The Cherokee leader John Ross was the first president. The constitution was based on the U.S. Constitution and the U.S. Bill of Rights. The Cherokee adopted the constitution with the hope of establishing a government that would protect their rights and secure their sovereignty. The constitution provided for a national legislature, a president, and a judiciary. The Cherokee government was the first Indian government to adopt a constitution. The Cherokee had been the first of the five civilized tribes to adopt a constitution. They had been the first to establish a national government, and the first to adopt a constitution.

a rift valley is evidence of which kind of plate boundary [/INST]
Ground truth: A rift valley is a linear - shaped lowland between several highlands or mountain ranges created by the action of a geologic rift or fault. A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary, a crustal extension, a spreading apart of the surface, which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion. When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart, a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks, forming a graben. The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new. That feature is the beginning of the rift valley, but as the process continues, the valley widens, until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area. One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift. On Earth, rifts can occur at all elevations, from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust. They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys, which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically.
[0.635, 0.075]Original response:  A rift valley is evidence for a divergent plate boundary. Rift valleys are long, narrow depressions in the Earth's surface that form when two tectonic plates are moving apart from each other. The most well-known example of a rift valley is the East African Rift System, which runs from Lebanon to Mozambique.

Divergent plate boundaries are areas where tectonic plates move apart from each other and new crust is created. As the plates move apart, magma rises to the surface and cools, forming new volcanic rocks. The rift valley itself is formed by the stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust as the plates move apart.

Other examples of rift valleys include the Rio Grande Rift in North America, the Red Sea Rift, and the Sunda Arc in Southeast Asia.
[0.666, 0.141]Prifix response: A rift valley is a linear or elongated depression or low-lying area created by the action of a tectonic plate or a plate boundary. A rift valley is typically a linear or elongate depression, which is formed by the action of a fault or a fault system. The depression is created when the Earth crust is stretched or pulled apart, and the rocks on either side of the fault move away from each other. The rift valley is a feature that is commonly found along the boundaries of tectonic plates that are moving apart, such as the East African Rift System, the Red Sea Rift, or the Rio Grande Rift. The rift valley can be a few kilometers or hundreds of kilometers long, and it is often associated with a series of faults that are parallel to the rift valley. The rift valley may be a few meters or hundreds of meters deep, and it is often filled with sediment that has accumulated in the rift valley. A rift valley can be formed by a variety of geologic processes, including tectonic plate movement, faulting, and volcanic activity. The rift valley, in turn, can be the result of

who helped in the creation of the coast guard [/INST]
Ground truth: While the modern Coast Guard was created by the merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service in 1915, its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton lobbied Congress to authorize a small fleet of vessels to enforce tariffs (an important source of revenue for the new nation). On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 100 revenue officers. From 1790, when the Continental Navy was disbanded, to 1798, when the United States Navy was created, these `` revenue cutters '' were the country's only naval force.
[0.584, 0.090]Original response:  The United States Coast Guard was created by a joint resolution of Congress on August 4, 1790, with the passage of the "Act to provide for the Government of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Coast Guard." This act was signed into law by President George Washington.

The Coast Guard was created to provide a unified maritime law enforcement agency for the United States, with responsibilities including search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, and maritime safety. The Coast Guard was also given the authority to enforce customs and immigration laws, as well as to conduct scientific research and survey work.

The Coast guard was created through the efforts of several individuals, including:

1. Alexander Hamilton: Hamilton was a Founding Father and the first Secretary of the Treasury. He played a key role in advocating for the creation of the Coast Guard, arguing that it was necessary for the protection of American maritime interests.
2. Thomas Jefferson: Jefferson was the third President of the United States and a strong supporter of the Coast Guard. He signed the act creating the Coast Guard in 1790.
3. Reverdy Johnson: Johnson was a Maryland lawyer
[0.656, 0.180]Prifix response: While the modern Coast Guard was created by the U.S. Congress in 1915 and its roots can be traced to the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life Saving Service, the Revenue Cutter service was created by the Tariff Act of 1862. The act authorized the construction of 100 revenue cutters (the term for the ships) to enforce the tariffs and trade laws of the United States. The Revenue Cutter Service was placed under the Treasury Department, and its officers were responsible for enforcing the tariffs, customs, and trade laws of the country. The Revenue Cutters were stationed along the coasts of the United States, and their primary mission was to interdict smugglers, prevent the illegal transportation of goods, and collect customs duties.

who died at the shootout at the ok corral [/INST]
Ground truth: The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral was a 30 - second shootout between lawmen and members of a loosely organized group of outlaws called the Cowboys that took place at about 3: 00 p.m. on Wednesday, October 26, 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. It is generally regarded as the most famous shootout in the history of the American Wild West. The gunfight was the result of a long - simmering feud, with Cowboys Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury on one side and town Marshal Virgil Earp, Special Policeman Morgan Earp, Special Policeman Wyatt Earp, and temporary policeman Doc Holliday on the other side. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys, who objected to the Earps ' interference in their illegal activities. Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Ike Clanton claimed that he was unarmed and ran from the fight, along with Billy Claiborne. Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday were wounded, but Wyatt Earp was unharmed. The shootout has come to represent a period of the American Old West when the frontier was virtually an open range for outlaws, largely unopposed by law enforcement officers who were spread thin over vast territories.

The most commonly cited accounts of the gunfight are based on the testimony of Wyatt Earp, who was the town marshal of Tombstone at the time. Earp and his brother Virgil, who was the city collector, Morgan Earp, and Doc Holliday, a close friend of the Earp brothers, had been involved in a long-standing feud with the Clanton gang, which was a group of outlawed cowboys that had been terrorizing the town. On October 26, the Earps and Holliday confronted the Clantons and Billy Clanton's half-brother, McLaury, at the O.K., Corral. The shootout lasted only about 30 seconds, and all of the Clanton gang were killed. The Earps and Hollidays were not injured. The shoot

what specific type of acquired immunity vaccines provide [/INST]
Ground truth: Artificially acquired active immunity can be induced by a vaccine, a substance that contains antigen. A vaccine stimulates a primary response against the antigen without causing symptoms of the disease. Richard Dunning coined the term vaccination, a colleague of Edward Jenner, and adapted by Louis Pasteur for his pioneering work in vaccination. The method Pasteur used entailed treating the infectious agents for those diseases, so they lost the ability to cause serious disease. Pasteur adopted the name vaccine as a generic term in honor of Jenner's discovery, which Pasteur's work built upon.
[0.518, 0.000]Original response:  Acquired immunity vaccines provides long-term immunity to a specific disease or infection. They work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a pathogen (such as a virus or bacteria) to the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies and immune cells that can recognize and fight off the pathogen if it were to enter the body in the future.

There are several types of acquired immunity v accines, including:

1. Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain a killed or inactivated form of the pathogen, which cannot cause disease but can still stimulate an immune response. Examples of inactivated vaccines include the flu vaccine and the HPV vaccine.
2. Live, attenuated vaccines: these vaccines contain a weakened form of the pathogen that can cause a mild infection in the body, but cannot cause the full-blown disease. Examples of live, attenuatedvaccines include the MMR vaccine and the chickenpox vaccine.
3. Subunit vaccines
[0.561, 0.124]Prifix response: Antibody dependent immunity can be induced by a vaccine, a process that involves a specific type of antibody. The antibody acts as a molecular mimicry, binding to a surface protein of a microorganism. The antibody binds to the surface protein, and the antibody dependent immunity provides a mechanism for the immune system to recognize the surface protein as a foreign molecule. The antibody dependent immunization provides a mechanism for the host to mount a response against the surface protein, which results in the production of antibodies that can neutralize the surface protein.

when do spring tides on earth take place [/INST]
Ground truth: The semi-diurnal range (the difference in height between high and low waters over about half a day) varies in a two - week cycle. Approximately twice a month, around new moon and full moon when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a configuration known as a syzygy), the tidal force due to the sun reinforces that due to the Moon. The tide's range is then at its maximum\; this is called the spring tide. It is not named after the season, but, like that word, derives from the meaning `` jump, burst forth, rise '', as in a natural spring.
[0.545, 0.000]Original response:  Spring tides occur when the Moon is in a specific position relative to the Earth and the Sun, causing the gravitational pull of the Moon on the Earth's oceans to be stronger than usual. This results in higher than usual water levels in the oceans, creating spring tides.

Spring tides typically occur during the following times:

1. When the Moon is in its perigee, which is the point in its orbit when it is closest to the Earth. This occurs about every 29.5 days.
2. When the Moon is aligned with the Sun and Earth, creating a syzygy. This occurs about every six months.
3. When the Moon is at its first or last quarter phase, which are the points in its orbit when it appears to be half-illuminated from the Earth's perspective. This occurs about every two weeks.

It's worth noting that the exact timing of spring tides can vary depending on the location on Earth and the specific alignment of the celestial bodies. However, the above times provide a general idea of when spring tides are most likely to occur.
[0.580, 0.065]Prifix response: The tidal range (the difference between the high and low tides) varies in the open ocean and around a coastline due to a combination of gravitational forces. The Moon, in particular, has a significant effect on the tides, as it is the closest large celestial body to the Earth, and its gravitational pull is the strongest. The Moon's gravitational pull causes the ocean to bulge outward, creating a tidal range. The tidal range is greatest when the Moon is at its closest point to the Earth, called perigee, and least when it is at its farthest point, called apogee. The difference between the perigee and apogee is about 14.5 days.

commonly used as a preservative for tissue specimens [/INST]
Ground truth: By far the most commonly used fixative in histology is formaldehyde. It is usually used as a 10 % neutral buffered formalin (NBF), that is approx. 3.7 % - 4.0 % formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline. Because formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, formalin - formaldehyde gas dissolved in water (~ 37 % w / v) is used when making the former fixative. Paraformaldehyde is a polymerized form of formaldehyde, usually obtained as a fine white powder, which depolymerises back to formalin when heated. Formaldehyde fixes tissue by cross-linking the proteins, primarily the residues of the basic amino acid lysine. Its effects are reversible by excess water and it avoids formalin pigmentation. Other benefits include: Long term storage and good tissue penetration. It is particularly good for immunohistochemistry techniques. Also the formaldehyde vapor can be used as a fixative for cell smears.
[0.608, 0.000]Original response:  Sure! Here are some commonly used preservatives for tissue specimins:

1. Formalin: Formalin is a solution of formaldehyde in water, which is commonly used to preserve tissue specimens for histopathology and microscopy. It helps to fix the tissue and prevent autolysis (self-digestion) and bacterial growth.
2. Ethanol: Ethanol is a solvent that can be used to preserve tissue samples by dehydrating them. It is often used in combination with other preservatives to enhance its effectiveness.
3. Methanol: Methanol is a soluble preservative that can be used to fix and preserve tissue samples. It is less toxic than formalin and can be used to preserve a wider range of tissue types.
4. Glutaraldehyde: Glutaraldehide is a fixative that is used to preserve tissue for electron microscopy. It is a strong fixative that can cross-link proteins and other biomolecules, resulting in a more stable tissue sample.
5. Cryopres
[0.637, 0.110]Prifix response: By most commonly used in the preservation of tissue samples it is usually a formalin solution. Formalin is usually a 40 % solution of formaldehyde in water (methanol). It is usually used as a fixative for tissue samples because it is a strong fixative that can cross-link proteins, which prevents degradation of the tissue. Formalin is also a good preservative because it is non-toxic, non-irritating, and non-reactive. It is usually used as the fixative for tissue specimen because it is a good fixative for tissue. Formaldehyde is usually used as a preservatives for tissue samples because of its ability to cross-link proteins. Formalin is a 40 % aqueous solution of formaldehydes, which is usually used as a tissue fixative because it is a strong cross-linking agent.

what is the style of arch found at the great mosque at cordoba [/INST]
Ground truth: The building is most notable for its arcaded hypostyle hall, with 856 columns of jasper, onyx, marble, and granite. These were made from pieces of the Roman temple which had occupied the site previously, as well as other destroyed Roman buildings, such as the Mérida amphitheatre. The double arches were a new introduction to architecture, permitting higher ceilings than would otherwise be possible with relatively low columns. The double arches consist of a lower horseshoe arch and an upper semi-circular arch. The famous alternating red and white voussoirs of the arches were inspired by those in the Dome of the Rock. and also resemble those of the Aachen Cathedral, which were built almost at the same time. Horseshoe arches were known in the Iberian Peninsula since late Antiquity, as can be seen on the 3rd - century `` Estela de los Flavios '', now in the arqueological museum of León. A centrally located honey - combed dome has blue tiles decorated with stars.

The mosque was originally built in the 8th century AD during the Umayyad Caliphate, and it underwent several expansions and renovations over the centuries.

The style of the arches in the Great Mosque of Corduba is primarily Islamic, with a distinctive horseshoe shape that is characteristic of many Islamic mosques. The arches are supported by columns, which are also decorated with Islamic motifs such as interlacing palm and pineapple designs. The arches are arranged in a series of naves and aisles, creating a vast and airy interior space.

However, the Great Mosque of cordoba also features some Christian elements, particularly in the later additions and renovations. For example, the church of San Salvador, which was built adjacent to the mosque during the Christian reconquest of Spain in the 13th century, features a Gothic-style arched ceiling that is visible from the mosque's interior.

who sang the original beauty and the beast song [/INST]
Ground truth: `` Beauty and the Beast '' is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for the Disney animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). The film's theme song, the Broadway - inspired ballad was first recorded by British - American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast, specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better. Additionally, the song's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a `` tale as old as time ''. Lansbury's rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between Belle and the Beast, while a shortened chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film, and the song's motif features frequently in other pieces of Menken's film score. Lansbury was initially hesitant to record `` Beauty and the Beast '' because she felt that it was not suitable for her aging singing voice, but ultimately completed the song in one take.
[0.627, 0.004]Original response:  The original Beauty and the Beast song was performed by Angela Lansbury in the 1991 Disney animated film. Angela Lansbury voiced the character of Mrs. Potts, who sings the iconic ballad "Beauty and the Beast."
[0.611, 0.123]Prifix response: Emma Ferber's rendition of the title song for the 1991 Disney animated feature film Beauty and the Beast is the best-known and most widely performed version of the song. The song was written by Howard Ashman (lyrics) and Alan Menken, and was first performed by Ferber in the film. The song was notably performed in the film by Ferber in the character of Belle, and was also included in the film's soundtrack. The song was not originally written for the film, but was instead written for the 1989 Broadway musical version of the story. The song was not included in the original 1946 film version of the story, and was not until the 1990s that the song became a hit. The song's success was largely due to the success of the film, and the song's popularity has continued to grow since its release. The song is now considered a classic of the Disney musical repertoire, and is one of the most well-known and best-loved songs in the Disney canon.

when do we say that two circles are congruent [/INST]
Ground truth: Two circles are congruent if they have the same diameter.
[0.630, 0.041]Original response:  Two circles are congruent if they have the same size and shape. In other words, if two circles have the same radius and the same center, they are congruent.

Here are some ways to determine if two circles are congruENT:

1. Radius Check: If the radii of the two circles are the same, then they are congruent (i.e., have the same size).
2. Center Check: If the centers of the two circles are at the same point, then they are congue (i.e., at the same location).
3. Diameter Check: If the diameters of the two circles are equal, then they are congugate (i.e., they have the same length).
4. Inscription Angle Check: If the angle between the two circles is 180 degrees, then they are conguent (i.e. they touch each other).

So, to answer your question, two circles are congruous when they have the same size, shape, and location.
[1.000, 1.000]Prifix response: Two circles are congruent if they have the same diameter.

what is a good signal to noise ratio for audio [/INST]
Ground truth: Signal - to - noise ratio (abbreviated SNR or S / N) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power, often expressed in decibels. A ratio higher than 1: 1 (greater than 0 dB) indicates more signal than noise.
[0.579, 0.000]Original response:  A good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for audio is generally considered to be between 15 dB and 20 dB. This means that for every 10 dB of signal power, there is a corresponding amount of noise power.

In more detail, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) recommends the following SNR levels for different types of audio signals:

* Speech: 15 dB to 20 dB
* Music: 10 dB to 15 dB
* Noise: 0 dB to 5 dB

It's worth noting that these are general guidelines, and the actual SNR required for a particular application may vary depending on the specific requirements of the system. For example, a voice over IP (VoIP) system may require a higher SNR than a music streaming service.

In practical terms, a higher SNR means that the signal is cleaner and less affected by noise, which can improve the overall quality of the audio. A lower SNR means that the noise level is higher, which can make the audio more difficult to listen to or understand.

where did the portuguese settle in the americas [/INST]
Ground truth: Based on the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Portuguese Crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by the Genoese explorer John Cabot in 1497 and 1498 on behalf of the Crown of England. To that end, in 1499 and 1500, the Portuguese mariner João Fernandes Lavrador visited the northeast Atlantic coast and Greenland, which accounts for the appearance of `` Labrador '' on topographical maps of the period. Subsequently, in 1501 and 1502, the Corte - Real brothers explored and charted Greenland and what is today the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, claiming these lands as part of the Portuguese Empire. Fragmentary evidence also suggests a previous expedition in 1473 by João Vaz Corte - Real, their father, with other Europeans, to Terra Nova do Bacalhau (Newfoundland of the Codfish) in North America. The possible voyage of 1473 and several other possible pre-Columbian expeditions to North America in the 15th century, mostly from the Azores in the case of the Portuguese (included in donation royal letters), remain matters of great controversy for scholars. Their existence is based on brief or fragmentary historical documents that are unclear concerning the destinations of voyages.
[0.541, 0.039]Original response:  The Portuguese established colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, primarily in the northeastern region of North America, known as the New England region. They settled along the coast of present-day Canada and the United States, particularly in the areas that are now known as:

1. Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada: The Portuguese established the first permanent settlement in North America at Cuper's Cove (present-day Cupids) on the island of Newfoundland in 1519.
2. Nova Scotia, Canada: The Portuguese settled in the area now known as Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, in 1753, and established the town of Lunenburg in 1757.
3. Massachusetts, United States: The Portuguese established the town of New Bedford in 1652 on the coast of Massachusetts.
4. Rhode Island, United States: ThePortuguese established the town of Newport in 1639 on the coast of Rhode Island.

These settlements were established primarily by fishermen and traders, who were attracted by the abundance of fish and other natural resources
[0.553, 0.000]Prifix response: Based on the text, the Portuguese had settlements in the New World, in the area that is now Brazil, in the northeastern part of the country and in the islands of the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans. The Portuguese had also settlements in the Caribbean and in the coastal areas of South America. The text also mentions that the Portuguese had settlements on the coast of North America, in the area that later became the United States. The text also mentions the settlements in the area of the present-day states of Florida and Louisiana. The text also mentions a settlement in the area of the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The text also mentions settlements in the area that is present-day California.

the overture of don giovanni is in what form [/INST]
Ground truth: Don Giovanni (Italian pronunciation: (dɔn dʒoˈvanni)\; K. 527\; complete title: Il dissoluto punito, ossia il Don Giovanni, literally The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni or The Libertine Punished) is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787. Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a dramma giocoso, a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an opera buffa. Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements.
[0.480, 0.000]Original response:  The overture of Don Giovanni is in the form of a sonata form. The sonata form is a musical structure that consists of three sections: an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation.

The exposition of the Don Giovanni overture introduces the main themes of the opera, including the famous "Largo" theme, which is introduced by the basses and cellos. The development section features a series of variations on these themes, with the addition of new material and a sense of building tension. The recapitulation brings the work full circle, with a restatement of the themes in their original form.

The sonata form used in the Don Giovanni overtue is a typical example of the classical sonata form, with a clear exposition, development, and recapitulation. The use of this structure allows Mozart to convey the drama and tension of the opera in a musical form that is both structured and expressive.
