Prompt: who was the first chief minister of west bengal
Ground truth: Since 1947, there have been eight Chief Ministers of West Bengal. The first was Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of the Indian National Congress, who was succeeded by his party-mates Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy and Prafulla Chandra Sen. A decade of instability followed, marred by fractious coalition governments and frequent impositions of President's rule. The instability ended with 1977 election victory of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). Headed by Jyoti Basu, the CPM-led Left Front government was in office for over 23 years (1977--2000). Left rule in West Bengal continued for another 10 years under Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, before its defeat in the 2011 election by the Trinamool Congress. Appointed on 20 May 2011, Trinamool leader Mamata Banerjee is the current incumbent, the state's first woman chief minister.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.233, 0.371, 0.139, 0.198, 0.603] Agent refined response: the term "dog and pony show" is a slang term that originated in the United States.

Over time, the term came to be used more broadly to refer to any kind of entertainment or spectacle that is considered to be overly elaborate or excessive.

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words"). The term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word.
[0.115, 0.172, 0.025, 0.123, 0.493] Agent refined response: "parole is an option for most prisoners." This means that after serving a certain portion of their sentence, prisoners may be eligible to be released on parole, which is supervision provided by a parole board. Parole allows individuals to serve the remainder of their sentence in the community rather than in prison, under the supervision of a parole officer.

During the parole process, the parole board will assess the individual's progress in their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. If the individual has made sufficient progress and has demonstrated that they are no longer a danger to society, the parole board may grant parole. However, parole is not guaranteed, and the parole board may deny parole if the individual has not made sufficient progress or if they are deemed to be a danger to society.

It is important to note that the specific eligibility requirements and parole process vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of offense committed. For example, in some jurisdictions, individuals convicted of first-degree murder may be eligible for parole after 25 or 30 years, while individuals convicted of less serious offenses may be eligible for paroles after a shorter period of time.
[0.296, 0.325, 0.052, 0.205, 0.536] Ori response: "parole is an option for most prisoners." This means that after serving a certain portion of their sentence, prisoners may be eligible for parole, which is a type of early release from prison. However, it is important to note that parole is not guaranteed, particularly in cases of life or indeterminate sentences, and the length of parole eligibility can vary depending on the circumstances of the offense and the individual case.

(In fact, Andy was much more the kind of detective Clark Jr. wanted to be, which is why he chose to transfer to the 15th when he earned a detective's shield and pick of assignments.) Clark Sr. later got busted for sleeping with a prostitute and let his son face the IAB accusation and potential discipline until Andy told him Clark Jr. was on the verge of being fired, which caused Clark Sr. to confess. After this, Clark Sr. began drinking heavily and became an IAB informant, which nearly ruined John's career at the 15th. His actions helped lead to the campaign by Officer Laughlin against Clark Jr., who finally told his father to stop making bad decisions on his behalf and stop drinking so much. A depressed Clark Sr. later committed suicide, which sent his son into a long depression of his own. Played by Joe Spano.

Ground truth: The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay, based on the U.S flag, where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance. The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santillán, the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti, the sun god of the Inca religion. It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.251, 0.271, 0.070, 0.140, 0.505] Agent refined response: a limit of a function does not exist in the following cases:



1. As special cases, limits on an interval have no value.
2. Left-hand limits of real-valued functions, such as taking $s$ to be an open interval of the format $(-\infty,a)$ or $(a,\infty)$.
3. Right-hand limits of real-valuED functions, such as taking $s$$ to be an open interval of theformat $(a, \infty)$ or $(-\infty,a)$.
4. The notion of one-sided limits is extended to the included endpoints of half-closed intervals, so the square root function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ can have limit $0$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from above.

In summary, a limit of a function does no exist in any of these special cases.
[0.273, 0.261, 0.076, 0.168, 0.554] Ori response: a limit of a function does not exist in the following cases:

1. As special cases, limits on an interval have no real value. For example, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 from the left does not exist.
2. Left-hand limits of real-valued functions. For instance, the limit of f(x)=√x as x approaches (−∞,a) does not exist.
3. Right-hand limits of real-valuED functions. For example, the limit of  f(x)=√x as  x approaches (a,∞) does not exist.
4. One-sided limits at the included endpoints of half-closed intervals. For instance, the limit of  f(n) as n approaches 0 from the right does not exist.

These are the scenarios where a limit of a function does not have a well-defined value.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

Prompt: how many inches is the iphone 5s screen
Ground truth: As of 2015--16, there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". The iPhone 5 was described as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.

Prompt: who gave the famous objective co relative theory
Ground truth: The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot, who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics. Helping define the objective correlative, Eliot's essay "Hamlet and His Problems", republished in his book The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare's incomplete development of Hamlet's emotions in the play Hamlet. Eliot uses Lady Macbeth's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative: "The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion.", as a contrast to Hamlet. According to Eliot, the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him. The objective correlative's purpose is to express the character's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as ". perhaps little more than the ancient distinction (first made by Plato) between mimesis and diegesis." (28). According to Formalist critics, this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work. The "occasion" of E. Montale is a further form of correlative.
[0.021, 0.254, 0.128, 0.181, 0.578] Agent refined response: T.S. Eliot is largely associated with the development of the theory of the objective correlative in literature. He is a poet and literary critic who is credited with advancing the idea that an objective correlative is a literary device used to provide explicit, rather than implicit, accessibility to traditionally inexplicable ideas such as emotion or color.
[0.015, 0.253, 0.117, 0.177, 0.580] Ori response: T.S. Eliot is largely associated with the development of the theory of the objective correlative in literature. Eliot, a poet and literary critic, wrote extensively on the concept of the objective correlative and its role in literature. He is credited with popularizing the term and its application in literary analysis.

Prompt: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany
Ground truth: Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould. Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.323, 0.492, 0.373, 0.444, 0.768] Agent refined response: bullets fired into the air usually  fall back with terminal velocities much slower than their muzzle velocity when leaving the barrel of a firearm [1]. This is because the force of gravity causes the bullet to slow down and descend back to the ground.

However, people can still be injured or killed by bullets discharged into the  air, even if they fall back to the ground at slower speeds. This is because the bullet can travel a significant distance before hitting the ground, and the force of the impact can be severe.

To illustrate this point, the knowledge provided states that bullets fired at angles less than  vertical are more dangerous because they maintain their angular ballistic trajectory and are less likely to engage in tumble motion. As a result, these bullets travel at speeds much higher than a  bullet in free fall, making them more likely to cause injury or death if they hit a person or other living thing [1].

In summary, bullets fired into the air can fall back to the ground at slower velocities than their muzzle velocity, but they can still cause harm if they hit a person or other object. It is important to exercise caution and avoid handling or playing with bullets in any situation.
[0.490, 0.596, 0.416, 0.490, 0.787] Ori response: bullets fired into the air usually  fall back with terminal velocities much  lower than their muzzle velocity  when they leave the barrel of  a firearm. This means that the bullets will not travel as fast as they would when fired horizontally or at a target. However, people can still be injured or killed if bullets fall back to the ground after being fired into the air.

Prompt: when did the right to buy scheme start
Ground truth: After Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979, the legislation to implement the Right to Buy was passed in the Housing Act 1980. Michael Heseltine, in his role as Secretary of State for the Environment, was in charge of implementing the legislation.

Prompt: where does the chinatown bus stop in nyc
Ground truth: Often, ticket booths are walk-up windows on the street, or are located inside restaurants and bakeries throughout a given Chinatown community, although it is not uncommon for tickets to be sold on the street directly. Some lines even simply collect cash payment after passengers have boarded the bus. However, tickets are often sold online, either by the bus companies themselves or by portals and print-outs of confirmation emails are used as tickets. Except in Boston, the lines rarely use stations of their own. Passengers are usually directed to wait along a given curbside for the arrival of the bus, although many companies offer waiting areas at or near the pickup points. Several bus stops are also near major hotels and in the parking areas of major Chinese supermarkets. In New York, several bus lines pick up passengers on a stretch of Forsyth Street at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in the Little Fuzhou neighborhood within Manhattan's Chinatown. Since 1998, when the New York City Department of Transportation marked the strip a bus layover area, the sidewalk between Division Street and East Broadway has served as a de facto terminal for the Chinatown buses.
[0.280, 0.251, 0.056, 0.145, 0.524] Agent refined response: Chinatown buses stop at several locations in New York City, including:

1. Long Island: Buses from Chinatown in New York City also link to the Chinatowns of Edison, New Jersey; Cherry Hill Mall; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Atlantic City.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.412, 0.372, 0.144, 0.219, 0.562] Agent refined response: trigger points are located in the muscles and are characterized by localized areas of muscle spasm, pain, and weakness. They are often found in the muscles of the neck, back, and limbs, and can also occur in other muscles throughout the body. The integrated hypothesis theory suggests that trigger points form from excessive releases of acetylcholine, which produces sustained depolarization (abnormal electrical activity) of muscle fibers. This can lead to the formation of trigger points, which are associated with pain deep within a joint where there is no muscle.
[0.248, 0.308, 0.081, 0.183, 0.529] Ori response: trigger points are located in the muscles of the body. More specifically, they are found in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles that are attached to the bones and help move the body's joints. Trigger points are areas within these muscles where there is a disruption in the normal muscle tissue, leading to pain and stiffness.

The exact location of trigger points can vary depending on the individual and the specific muscle affected. However, they are often found in areas where there is a lot of muscle activity, such as the neck, back, and shoulders. Trigger points in these areas can cause widespread pain and discomfort, as well as limited range of motion and stiffness.

Some common locations for trigger points include:

* The neck and shoulder muscles, which can cause pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and even the arms.
* The back muscles, which can cause pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the upper and lower back.
* The abdominal muscles, which can cause pain in the abdomen, back, and even the legs.
* The glute

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.358, 0.380, 0.117, 0.231, 0.595] Agent refined response: the term "pop music" originated in the early 20th century as a contraction of the term "popular music." This term was used to describe music that was popular among the masses, as opposed to classical music or jazz, which were considered more highbrow. The term "pop music" was first used in the 1920s to describe the emerging popular music of the time, which was characterized by its catchy melodies and lyrics, and its focus on mass appeal. Over time, the term "pop music" has come to be used to describe a wide range of musical styles, including rock, R&B, hip-hop, and electronic music, among others.
[0.318, 0.388, 0.122, 0.233, 0.599] Ori response: the term "pop music" originated in the early 20th century as a description of popular music, which was seen as a distinct genre from traditional classical music. The term "pop" was used to refer to music that was popular and widely enjoyed by the masses, as opposed to classical music, which was seen as more elite and sophisticated. Over time, the term "pop music" became the commonly used term to refer to popular music, and it has since become a catch-all term for a wide range of musical styles, including rock, hip-hop, electronic, and more.

Prompt: when was the last time mount ruapehu erupted
Ground truth: At about 8: 20 p.m. on 25 September 2007, a hydrothermal eruption occurred without warning. William Pike, a 22-year-old primary school teacher, had a leg crushed by a rock during the eruption and a rescue operation was mounted to rescue him from the Dome Shelter near the crater. The rock crashed into the Dome Shelter, landed on the man and was too heavy for his companion to lift off.
[0.152, 0.160, 0.009, 0.113, 0.447] Agent refined response: Mount Ruapehu is an active volcano located in the Tongariro National Park in the North Island of New Zealand. The last time Mount Ruapehu erupted was in 1995-1996, with a series of small-scale eruptions that occurred over a period of several months.

The eruptions were characterized by the emission of steam and ash, and were monitored by volcanologists from the New Zealand Geological Survey. The eruptions were relatively small, with the largest event producing a 200-meter (660-foot) high ash plume.

It is worth noting that Mount Ruapehu is an ongoing volcanic system, and while the 1995-1 nine eruptions were significant, they were not the first time the volcano has erupted in recent history. In fact, there have been at least 50 years between major eruptions of Mount Ruapehu, with the previous major eruption occurring in 1945.
[0.199, 0.208, 0.029, 0.123, 0.455] Ori response: Mount Ruapehu is an active volcano located in the Tongariro National Park in the North Island of New Zealand. It is known for its geothermal activity and has erupted several times in the past.

The last major eruption of Mount Ruapehu occurred in 1995-1996, when the volcano produced a large amount of volcanic ash and gas. The eruption was characterized by the formation of a 100-meter-high (330 ft) lava fountain, and the release of ash and gas into the atmosphere.

There have been several smaller eruptions of Mount Ruapehu since then, including a minor eruption in 2003 and a larger eruption in 2014. The volcano is considered to be in a state of continuous unrest, with ongoing geothermal activity and frequent earthquakes.

Therefore, the answer to the question of when Mount Ruapehu last erupted is: 1995-1096.

Prompt: when did they start vaccinating for whooping cough
Ground truth: Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.
[0.204, 0.186, 0.024, 0.116, 0.484] Agent refined response: 1910 is the year when the zoonotic disease of whooping cough was first identified as a bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. However, the knowledge gained in the 1930's suggests that the bacteria lost their pathogenic properties when repeatedly spread on agar media, which may have affected the reproducibility of results from different studies.



Therefore, it is not explicitly mentioned when vaccination for whooping cough started, but it is likely that vaccination programs for B. pertussis began in the early 20th century, around the time when the bacterial cause of the disease was identified.
[0.167, 0.163, 0.019, 0.115, 0.491] Ori response: knowledge was gained in the 1930's that the bacteria lost their pathogenic power when repeatedly spread on agar medium. This means that the bacteria, Bordetella pertussis, became less virulent when grown on a nutrient-rich agar plate. This discovery helped explain why different studies had difficulty reproducing results, as the bacteria were not consistently handled before being inoculated.

As for vaccination against whooping cough, the information provided does not mention a specific time period when vaccination against the disease began. However, it is known that vaccination against Bordetella pertussis has been available since the early 20th century, with the first vaccine being developed in the 1910s. The vaccine was initially made from killed bacteria, but later versions were created using inactivated or weakened bacteria to reduce the risk of adverse reactions.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.333, 0.385, 0.150, 0.236, 0.603] Agent refined response: the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is a well-known phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence. The Declaration states that these three things are among the "unalienable rights" that have been given to all human beingen by their Creator, and that governments are created to protect. However, the Declaration of Independence is not a part of the United States Constitution.



The United States Constitution does not explicitly mention the phrase "life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness." However, the Constitution does include provisions related to individual rights and freedoms, such as the Bill of Rights, which includes the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, religion, and the press, as well as the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. These provisions are often interpreted as protecting the individual's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit happiness.







In summary, while the phrase "life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness" is not explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution, the Constitution does include provisions that protect individual rights and freedoms, which are often interpreted as protecting the right to life, liberty
[0.400, 0.400, 0.132, 0.223, 0.588] Ori response: "life, liberty and the pursuit of happines" is a phrase from the United States Declaration of Independence. It is not directly mentioned in the United States Constitution, but the concept of "pursuit of happiness" is interpreted to mean the right to pursue one's own happiness or well-being, which is protected by the Constitution's Bill of Rights.

The Constitution does not explicitly mention the term "pursuit of happiness," but it does provide for individual rights and freedoms, including the right to life, liberty, and property. The Supreme Court has interpreted these rights to include the right to pursue one'se own happiness, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others.

In summary, while the phrase "life, liberty and the pursuits of happiness" is not in the Constitution, the idea of pursuing one's own happiness is an implied right protected by the Constitution's Bill or Rights.

Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit through the Boy Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership all before or by age 18. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements. Many famous Americans are Eagle Scouts: astronaut Neil Armstrong, film director Michael Moore, TV host Mike Rowe, Steven Spielberg, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and President Gerald Ford are just a small sample of Eagle Scouts.
[0.121, 0.183, 0.025, 0.100, 0.468] Agent refined response: all former presidents of the United States serve as honorary vice presidents of the Boy Scouts of America for their lifetimes. Therefore, all former presidents have been or will be honorary vice presidents of the organization.

So, to answer your question, none of the former presidents have been a Boy Scout in the classical sense, as they are all adults who served as president after becoming adults. However, they have all been recognized as honorary vice presidents of BSA for their lifetimes.
[0.006, 0.147, 0.043, 0.084, 0.461] Ori response: all former presidents of the United States serve as honorary vice presidents of the Boy Scouts of America for their lifetimes. Therefore, every former U.S. president has been a Boy Scout.

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

[0.102, 0.151, 0.000, 0.132, 0.533] Ori response: communities of similar organisms found in a specific environment are called "ecosystems."

Ecosystems are communities of living organisms (such as plants, animals, and microorganisms) that interact with one another and their environment. These interactions include nutrient cycling, energy flow, and the exchange of gases and other chemicals. The living organisms in an ecosystem are interconnected and interdependent, and their interactions with their environment shape the structure and function of the ecosystem.

Ecosystems can be found in a variety of environments, including forests, grasslands, deserts, oceans, and even urban areas. Each ecosystem has its unique characteristics, such as the types of plants and animals that live there, the amount of sunlight and water it receives, and the types of nutrients and pollutants that are present.

Ecosystems are important for a variety of reasons, including providing food, fiber, and other resources for humans, supporting biodiversity and ecological resilience, and regulating the Earth's climate and weather patterns. Understanding ecosystems and their interactions with the environment is essential for managing and

Prompt: bowler to take hattrick in both inning in test match
Ground truth: A player has taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career.

Prompt: who is the new york state senate majority leader
Ground truth: There was a lengthy dispute over the leadership of the Senate during June and July 2009. On June 8, 2009, Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada, Jr., joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos. Following the precedent of 1913, the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario. Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer's resignation, the majority leaders (Bruno, Skelos and Smith) have acted as lieutenant governors. The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate, which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor. The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8. The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11, 2009. The dispute ended July 9, 2009, when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader, while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore, and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date. Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate, Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader, but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges. The current majority leader, or president, is John J. Flanagan.

Prompt: when did the soviet union start and end
Ground truth: The Soviet Union (Russian: Сове́тский Сою́з, tr.

Soyuz Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik, IPA: (sɐˈjus sɐˈvjɛtskjɪx sətsɨəljɪsˈtjitɕɪskjɪx rjɪˈspubljɪk) (listen)), abbreviated as USSR (Russian: СССР, tr. SSSR), was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects. Other major urban centres were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. The Soviet Union was one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact.
[0.075, 0.282, 0.051, 0.173, 0.451] Agent refined response: the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian Republics in  1922. Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s after Lenin's death in 1024 and initiated a centrally-planned economy, leading to a period of rapid industrialization, and collectivization.



Therefore, the Soviet Union started in 1922 and ended in 1991, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of independent states.
[0.182, 0.308, 0.071, 0.167, 0.448] Ori response: the Soviet Union was formed through the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian Republics in 1922.

Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s after Lenin's death in 1024.

The period of rapid industrialization and collectvization began during Stalin's rule, and the late 1930s saw the Great Purge, which resulted in the removal of Stalin's opponents within and outisde of the party through arbitrary arrests and persecutions, resulting in an estimated 6 million deaths.

Therefore, the dates for when the Soviet Union started and ended are:

Started: 1922 (formation of the Soviet Union)
Ended: 1991 (dissolution of the Soviet Union)

Prompt: where does cleavage of the peptide bond by chymotrypsin occur
Ground truth: Chymotrypsin (EC 3.4. 21.1, chymotrypsins A and B, alpha-chymar ophth, avazyme, chymar, chymotest, enzeon, quimar, quimotrase, alpha-chymar, alpha-chymotrypsin A, alpha-chymotrypsin) is a digestive enzyme component of pancreatic juice acting in the duodenum where it performs proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides. Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side-chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine). These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a ' hydrophobic pocket ' (the S position) of the enzyme. It is activated in the presence of trypsin. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P sidechain and the enzyme S binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme. Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates, particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P position.
[0.000, 0.103, 0.023, 0.080, 0.532] Agent refined response: the cleavage of the peptid bond by chymotrypsins occurs in the digestive systems of various organisms.
[0.018, 0.184, 0.031, 0.143, 0.574] Ori response: chymotrypsin facilitates the cleavage  of peptide bonds by hydrolysis reaction, which occurs extremely slowly in the absence of  a catalyst. Therefore, the cleavage of the peptid bond by chymotryps in occurs in the digestive systems of  many organisms.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.324, 0.325, 0.092, 0.234, 0.546] Agent refined response: hormones of the anterior psuedogland are created in the following locations:

1. Hypothalamus: The hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin.
2. Anterior pituitary gland: The hypothalamus releases CRH and vasopressin, which activates the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary.
3. Adrenal cortex: Stress-induced release of CRH and vasopressin from the anterior pituitary leads to the production of glucocorticoids such a cortisol by the adrenal cortex.

Therefore, the hormones of the anterior hypophysis are created in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, and adrenal cortex.
[0.232, 0.258, 0.065, 0.183, 0.528] Ori response: the hormones of the anterior pituiary gland are created through the following process:

1. Stress: Stress induces the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from the hypthalamus.
2. Activation of the adrenal cortex: CRH and vasopressin activate the release of adrenocortcotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary Gland.
3. Production of glucocorticoids: ACTH acts on the adrenal cortexto produce glucocorticoids, such as cortisol.
4. Negative feedback: The glucocorticoids produced by the adrenal cortex act back on the anterior pituiaty gland and the hypothalamu with negative feedback to slow the production  of CRH.

Therefore, the hormones of the anteriorpituitary gland are created in the hypothalamus and the adrenal cortex through a complex interplay of hormones and feedback mechanisms.

Prompt: where did the beer hall putsch take place
Ground truth: The Beer Hall Putsch, also known as the Munich Putsch, and, in German, as the Hitlerputsch, Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch, Bürgerbräu-Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle, was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler--along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders--to seize power in Munich, Bavaria, during 8--9 November 1923. About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers. Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, Hitler was arrested and charged with treason.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.
[0.026, 0.284, 0.195, 0.205, 0.641] Agent refined response: it was the "seer" or "haruspex" named Spurinna who said "Beware the ides of March" to Julius Caesar on his way to the theater of Pompey, where he would be assasinated.

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.341, 0.371, 0.019, 0.181, 0.599] Agent refined response: endocrine gland secretory cells secrete their products through the following mechanisms:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, including enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin. Examples include Brunner's glands, esaphageal glands, and plyoric glands.
3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucin. Examples include the salivary glands, with the parotid gland being 20% serous.
4. Holocrine secretion - the entire cell disintegrates and excretes its substance. Examples include sebaceous glands of skin and nose.
5. Apocrine secretion - a portion of the cell membranes that contain excretion buds off.

So, endocrine gland secretary cells secrete their products through different mechanisms depending on the type of cell.
[0.333, 0.366, 0.019, 0.169, 0.601] Ori response: secretory cells of endocrine cells secrete their products through the following mechanisms:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, including enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin. Examples include Brunner's glands, esaphageal glands, and plyoric glands.
3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucus. Examples include the salivary glands, although the Parotid gland is 20% predominantly serous.
4. Apocrine secretion - a portion of the cell membranes containing excretion buds off.

Prompt: who was the first signatory of the israeli declaration of independence
Ground truth: As leader of the Yishuv, David Ben-Gurion was the first person to sign. The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of Moetzet HaAm. However, twelve members could not attend, eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad. The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign, leaving spaces for those absent. Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner, Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column, leading to speculation that Vilner's name had been left alone to isolate him, or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration. However, Warhaftig later denied this, stating that a space had been left for him (as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically, but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father's memory and so moved down two spaces. He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories, and remained close for the rest of their lives. Of the signatories, two were women (Golda Meir (Meyerson/Myerson) and Rachel Cohen-Kagan).

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).
[0.229, 0.257, 0.058, 0.161, 0.508] Agent refined response: 14 years is the estimated time span for the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, with a peak workforce of roughly 30,000 people. This estimate is based on a modern construction management study in association with Egyptologists, which suggests that the total project required an average of 14,500 workers and a peak of around 40,000 people. Without the use of pulleys, wheel, or iron tools, the ancient Egyptians used critical path analysis methods to complete the construction of the Great Pyramids from start to finish in approximately 30 years.

Prompt: a type of basic rock popular in the 1980s
Ground truth: By the late 1960s "classic rock" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and synth-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.

Prompt: where did the rulers of the qing dynasty originate
Ground truth: The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria. In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing "Banners", military-social units that included Jurchen, Han Chinese, and Mongol elements. Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity, which he renamed as the Manchus. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital, Beijing. Rather than serve them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and seized the capital. Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661--1722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia. The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their title was Emperor, they used "Bogd khaan" to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.

Prompt: who represents the insured in the investigation of a claim
Ground truth: Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.
[0.184, 0.327, 0.130, 0.200, 0.605] Agent refined response: a claims adjuster or public adjusters represent the insured in the investigation of claims. They do not practice law, but rather assess and evaluate the covered injuries or damages to determine the extent of coverage according to the applicable law.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.306, 0.370, 0.087, 0.222, 0.605] Agent refined response: a dieback or population crash occurs when the rate of reproduction is higher than the death rate, leading to an increase in population density. This can happen due to lag effects, where the population grows rapidly before the death rate catches up. Overshoot can occur when reproduction rates remain high relative to the death rate, leading to a decline in population density and a subsequent collapse of the population.
[0.407, 0.522, 0.277, 0.360, 0.707] Ori response: a die-off or population crash occurs when the rate of death exceeds the rate of reproduction, leading to a decline in population density. This can happen when there are lag effects, meaning that reproduction rates remain high relative to the death rate, leading to an overshoot in population growth. The entire sequence or trajectory undergoned by the population and its environment together are termed "overshoot-and-collapse."

Prompt: who did puss in boots grew up with
Ground truth: Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a talking cat named for his signature pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive on the run from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.106, 0.207, 0.040, 0.158, 0.586] Agent refined response: male pattern baldness, also known as androgenic or male pattern alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss due to the presence of androgens (male hormones) in their bodies. The hair loss typically begins with a receding hairline and/or a thinning of hair on the top of the head.


There are several factors that can contribute to the development of male pattern baldness, including:

1. Genetics: Male pattern baldness tends to run in families, suggesting that there may be a genetic component to the condition.
2. Aging: Male pattern baldness is more common in older men, with the risk of hair loss increasing with age.
3. Hormonal imbalance: Androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a role in the development of male pattern baldness. An imbalance of these hormones can lead to hair loss.
4. Stress: Prolonged periods of stress can contribute to hair loss in some men.
5. Poor diet: A diet that is deficient in essential nutrients, such as iron, zinc, or biotin, can lead to hair loss
[0.097, 0.186, 0.050, 0.147, 0.601] Ori response: male pattern baldness, also known as androgenic or male pattern alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss in a specific pattern, typically starting with the temples and crown of the head. It is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors, with the primary hormone involved being dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

There are several studies that have investigated the genetic and hormonal factors that contribute to male pattern baldness. For example, one study found that the presence of a specific genetic variant in the AR gene, which codes for the androgen receptor, is associated with an increased risk of developing male pattern baldness. Another study found that levels of DHT are significantly higher in men with male pattern baldness compared to those without the condition.

It is important to note that male pattern baldness is a complex condition, and multiple factors are likely involved in its development. While genetics and hormones are thought to play a significant role, other factors such as age, stress, and overall health may also contribute to the condition.

Prompt: what states do not allow daylight savings time
Ground truth: Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year, so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time (DST), the exceptions being Arizona (except for the Navajo, who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands), Hawaii, and the overseas territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US.

Prompt: who won the nobel peace prize for 2017
Ground truth: The 2017 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) "for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition on such weapons," according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee announcement on October 6, 2017. The award announcement acknowledged the fact that "the world's nine nuclear-armed powers and their allies" neither signed nor supported the treaty-based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty, yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give "encouragement to all players in the field" to disarm. The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty, but drew criticism from those opposed. At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10, 2017, Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.361, 0.256, 0.091, 0.192, 0.485] Agent refined response: the 3 layers of the meninge are:

1. Dura mater: the outermost layer, characterized by multiple interdigitated cell processes, no extracellural collagen, and significant extracelullar spaces.
2. Middle region: a mostly fibrous portion consisting of two layers: the endosteal layer, closest to the calvaria (skullcap), and the inner meningeal layer closer to the brain.
3. Pia mater: the innermost layer, composed of dense fibrous tissues and inner surface covered by capillaries.
[0.323, 0.304, 0.093, 0.175, 0.520] Ori response: the 3 layers of the meninx are:

1. Dura mater (tough mother): a thick, durable membrane closest to the skull and vertebrate. It is a loosely arranged, fiberous layer of cells with multiple interdigitating cell processes, little extracellular collagen, significant amounts of ground substance, and no distinctive nervous plexuses.
2. Arachnoid mater (spider-like): a delicate, fibrous membrane that is the middle layer of the meninges. It is a well-vascularized structure composed of thin, delicate, branching fibers that give it a spider-like appearance.
3. Pia mater (delicate mother): the innermost layer of the meninges, a delicate, vascular membrane that closely adheres to the surface of the brain and spinal cord. It is composed of a thin layer of flattened epithelial cells that form a continuous surface with the neural tissue.

Prompt: where do pineapples come from in the world
Ground truth: Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in five to ten months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest. In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
[0.275, 0.246, 0.018, 0.175, 0.531] Agent refined response: pineapples originated in South America, and were later introduced to Europe through the Columbian exchange. In the 16th century, pineapples were grown in heated pits in botanical gardens such as the Chelsea Physic Garden in England. Prior to this, the only way to taste pineapples was where they were cultivated, which limited their availability to a small elite with access to glasshouses.
[0.041, 0.212, 0.062, 0.182, 0.541] Ori response: pineapples originated in South America, specifically in the tropical regions of Brazil and Paraguay.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.382, 0.374, 0.099, 0.236, 0.596] Agent refined response: cones are located in various parts of the retina, but are much less numerous than rods. However, they are greatly outnumbered by rods in most parts of the eye, but they are more concentrated in the fovea. Specifically, cones are located in the following areas of the eye:

1. Fovea: Cones are most densely packed in the fovea, which is located in the center of the retina.
2. Periphery: Cones are also found in the peripheral areas of the retina, but in smaller numbers than in the fovea.



In terms of their exact location within the eye, cones are typically 40-50 micrometers long and have a diameter that varies from 0.5 to 4.0 micrometers, with the smallest and most tightly packed cones located at the center of the eye in the fovea. The spacing of the cones is slightly larger than the others.

Please let me know if you have any further questions!
[0.186, 0.344, 0.110, 0.208, 0.586] Ori response: cones are located in the fovea, which is a specific area in the center of the retina. The fovea is a small, specialized area in the retina that is responsible for high-resolution vision and color perception. Cones are much less numerous than rods, but they greatly outnumber rods in the  fovea. In the fovea, cones are arranged in a specific pattern, with the s cone spacing slightly larger than the others.

Prompt: what stage of the star life cycle is the sun in
Ground truth: The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star. The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases the pressure on the core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.
[0.000, 0.088, 0.054, 0.071, 0.484] Agent refined response: the sun is currently in the main sequence stage of its life cycle.
[0.071, 0.310, 0.121, 0.176, 0.630] Ori response: the sun is currently in the main sequence stage of its life cycle. This stage is marked by the star's stable and continuous nuclear fusion reactions in its core, which provide the energy that powers the star's luminosity. The sun has been in this stage for about 4.6 billion years and will remain here for another 5 billion years or so before entering the red giant branch phase.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Prompt: name of black man in to kill a mockingbird
Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.389, 0.546, 0.354, 0.404, 0.708] Agent refined response: connective tissue is found throughout the body, including the nervous and circulatory systems. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which are the three outer membranes that envelop the brain and spine, are composed of connective tissue and provide support and protection to the brain and spinal cord.

Prompt: explain the function of the peripheral nervous system
Ground truth: The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two components of the nervous system, the other part is the central nervous system (CNS). The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood--brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon. Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS. The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.
[0.313, 0.366, 0.172, 0.263, 0.613] Agent refined response: the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has two primary functions:

1. Regulation of involuntary actions: The PNS is responsible for regulating involuntary actions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing. It does this through the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the "fight or flight" response, while the parasympathetic nervosa system is responsible for the "rest and digest" response.

2. Sensory functions: The PNS also plays a role in sensory functions, such as transmitting sensory information from the body to the brain. This includes sensations such as pain, temperature, touch, and pressure.

In summary, the PNS regulates involuntary actions and sensory functions, while the central nervous system (CNS) is responsible for controlling voluntary actions and cognitive functions.
[0.423, 0.438, 0.233, 0.306, 0.664] Ori response: the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is a part of the nervous system that connects the central nervous system (CNS) to the rest of the body. It consists of sensory receptors, nerves, and ganglia that transmit signals between the CNS and the rest of the body. The PNS is responsible for the following functions:

1. Sensory Functions: The PNS transmits sensory information from the body to the CNS, which helps us perceive the environment around us. For example, the PNS carries information from our skin, muscles, and organs to the brain, allowing us to feel pain, temperature, touch, and other sensations.
2. Autonomic Functions: The PNS regulates the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and respiration. The PNS helps maintain homeostasis by controlling the autonomic nervous system.
3. Motor Functions: The PNS transmitted signals from the CNS to muscles and glands throughout the body, allowing for voluntary movements and secretions.
4. Regulation of Body Functions

Prompt: what is the approximate volume of the brain
Ground truth: Studies on human brain size, largely based on participants of European ancestry, tend to find an average adult brain volume of 1260 cubic centimeters (cm) for men and 1130 cm for women. There is, however, substantial variation between individuals; one study of 46 adults, aged 22--49 years and of mainly European descent, found an average brain volume of 1273.6 cm for men, with a range of 1052.9 to 1498.5 cm, and 1131.1 cm for women, with a range of 974.9 to 1398.1 cm.
[0.166, 0.266, 0.071, 0.140, 0.576] Agent refined response: the average brain volume of modern humans is approximately 1,300-1,450 cm (or 1.3-1.45 liters). However, it is important to note that brain size can vary significantly among individuals and populations, and there is ongoing debate among researchers about the significance of brain size changes in human evolution.
[0.195, 0.331, 0.117, 0.201, 0.571] Ori response: the average brain volume of modern humans is approximately 1,300-1,450 cm3 (cubic centimeters).

Prompt: what do the 3 dots mean in math
Ground truth: In logical argument and mathematical proof, the therefore sign (∴) is generally used before a logical consequence, such as the conclusion of a syllogism. The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read therefore. It is encoded at U + 2234 ∴ therefore (HTML & # 8756; &there4;). For common use in Microsoft Office hold the ALT key and type "8756". While it is not generally used in formal writing, it is used in mathematics and shorthand. It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.316, 0.341, 0.024, 0.153, 0.536] Agent refined response: 3 dots in a triangle shape are used to signify "therefore" in the 18th century. However, there wasn't much consistency in how the triangle was oriented, and the notation became rare in continental Europe but remained popular in the British Isles.
 In the 19th century, the three-dot notation for "therefore" originated, and it remains popular in the British Isles. An example of its use in a syllogism is:

All gods are immortal.
Zeus is a god.
Zeus is immortal.

X + 1 = 6.
[0.265, 0.306, 0.043, 0.170, 0.560] Ori response: 3 dots in a triangle shape are used to signify "therefore" in the 18th century. However, there wasn't much consistency in how the triangle was oriented, and the notation became rare in continental Europe but remained popular in the British Isles. In the 19th century, the three-dot notation for "therefore" originated, and it is still used in some contexts, such as in a syllogism:

All gods are immortal.
Zeus is a god.
Zeus is immortal.

In math, the three dots are not typically used to signify "therefore." They are often used to indicate a sequence of mathematical operations or to separate lines of mathematical expressions. For example:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

Or:

2 + 3 + 4 = 9

In summary, the three dots in a triangle shape are not a standard mathematical notation, and their meaning can vary depending on the context in which they are used.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.251, 0.340, 0.112, 0.190, 0.579] Agent refined response: 

The term "dog and pony show" is believed to have originated in the United States in the mid-20th century, and it is used to describe a political or media event that is perceived as being superficial or insincere. The term is thought to have originated from the idea that politicians or other public figures would use a "dog and pony show" to distract the public from more important issues or to present a false image of themselves or their policies. The term is often used in a negative context to suggest that someone is trying to deceive or manipulate others through empty rhetoric or showmanship.
[0.255, 0.335, 0.137, 0.183, 0.583] Ori response: 

The term "dog and pony show" is believed to have originated in the United States in the mid-20th century. The exact origin of the term is unclear, but it is thought to have been used in the entertainment industry to refer to a low-quality or unimpressive show or performance. The term "dog" may have been used to refer to something that is old or outdated, while "pony" may have been used to refer something that is small or unimpressive. Over time, the term "dog and pony show " has been used more broadly to refer to any unimpressive or uninteresting event or performance.

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words"). The term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word.
[0.140, 0.210, 0.046, 0.155, 0.524] Agent refined response: being on parole means that a person who has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to serve time in a federal correctional facility, has the opportunity to be released from prison early, subject to certain conditions and supervision by a parole officer. However, parole is not guaranteed and can be denied or revoked if the offender violates the terms of their parole.

In the case of federal offenses, parole is typically available for offenders who have been sentenced to serve no less than 2 years. However, the sentencing judge has the discretion to impose a longer period of parole ineligibility, particularly for offenders convicted of serious crimes such as first-degree murder.

It's worth noting that parole is not the same as probation, which is a type of community supervision that is available for offenders who have been convicted of less serious crimes. Parole is a form of early release from prison, while probation is a type of community supervision granted to offenders who have not been convicted of a crime.
[0.217, 0.310, 0.039, 0.168, 0.523] Ori response: being on parole means that a prisoner who has been released from prison after serving a sentence of at least two years, is supervised by a parole officer in the community. During this time, the parolee is required to follow certain rules and conditions, such as reporting regularly to their parole officer, maintaining employment or attending school, and avoiding contact with certain people or places. Parole is not guaranteed, and the length of parole supervision can vary depending on the type of offense and the sentence imposed. In some cases, such as first-degree murder, parole may not be available until after 25 years have passed since the conviction.

The first half of training camp is usually focused on conditioning and individual drills, while the latter half leads directly into the exhibition season. With NFL training camps starting in late July, the biggest concern has been dehydration, as highlighted by the death of Minnesota Vikings player Korey Stringer in 2001 due to dehydration and heat stroke. As a result, the NFL has changed their training policies to prioritize player safety.

Prompt: what does the sun represent on the uruguay flag
Ground truth: The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay, based on the U.S flag, where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance. The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santillán, the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti, the sun god of the Inca religion. It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia.
[0.328, 0.519, 0.313, 0.272, 0.632] Agent refined response: The sun represents Inti, the sun god of the Inca religion, on the flag of Argentina and the coat of arms of Bolivia. However, there is no mention of the sun representing anything on the flag of Uruguay. Therefore, the answer to the user's question is that the sun does not represent anything on the Uruguay flag.

Prompt: who played john clark sr on nypd blue
Ground truth: Det. John Clark Sr.--John Clark Jr.'s father. An average detective from a low crime precinct mutually despised by Sipowicz, who called him "Dutch Boy" in reference to a plaster marketing statue he once shot in the dark thinking it was a suspect with a gun. He threw his son out of the house when John Jr. decided to work at the 15th with Andy; his partner and he later worked a case with Clark Jr. and Andy that revealed Clark Sr.'s by-the-book approach and hyper-sensitivity to his son being anything like Andy. (In fact, Andy was much more the kind of detective Clark Jr. wanted to be, which is why he chose to transfer to the 15th when he earned a detective's shield and pick of assignments.) Clark Sr. later got busted for sleeping with a prostitute and let his son face the IAB accusation and potential discipline until Andy told him Clark Jr. was on the verge of being fired, which caused Clark Sr. to confess. After this, Clark Sr. began drinking heavily and became an IAB informant, which nearly ruined John's career at the 15th. His actions helped lead to the campaign by Officer Laughlin against Clark Jr., who finally told his father to stop making bad decisions on his behalf and stop drinking so much. A depressed Clark Sr. later committed suicide, which sent his son into a long depression of his own. Played by Joe Spano.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.281, 0.258, 0.087, 0.153, 0.530] Agent refined response: 

A limit of a function does not exist in the following situations:

1. As $s$ approaches an open interval of the form $(-\infty,a)$ (i.e., to the left of $a$) or $(a,\infty)$ (i.e., tothe right of $a$), the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$ may not exist.
2. When $x$ approaches a half-closed interval's included endpoint (e.g., $x$ approaches $0$ from below in the interval $(0,1)$).

In these situations, the limit of the function may not exist due to the lack of a well-defined value for the limit as $s$ approaches the specified point.
[0.216, 0.239, 0.080, 0.159, 0.523] Ori response: 

A limit of a function does not exist in the following cases:

1. When the domain of the function is not a closed interval.
2. When the limit is taken as the variable approaches a point in the domain of the function from an open interval.
3. When the limit is taken as an open interval of the form (a, ∞) or (−∞, a), where a is a real number.
4. When the function has a vertical asymptote.
5. When the function has a discontinuity at the point where the limit is taken.
6. When the function has a jump discontinuity at the point where limit is taken.
7. When the function has a cusp discontinuity at the point where limits are taken.
8. When the function has a infinite limit as the variable approaches a point in its domain.

It is important to note that these are some of the common cases where a limit may not exist, but there could be other cases depending on the specific function and its properties.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

Prompt: how many inches is the iphone 5s screen
Ground truth: As of 2015--16, there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". The iPhone 5 was described as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.

Prompt: who gave the famous objective co relative theory
Ground truth: The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot, who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics. Helping define the objective correlative, Eliot's essay "Hamlet and His Problems", republished in his book The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare's incomplete development of Hamlet's emotions in the play Hamlet. Eliot uses Lady Macbeth's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative: "The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion.", as a contrast to Hamlet. According to Eliot, the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him. The objective correlative's purpose is to express the character's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as ". perhaps little more than the ancient distinction (first made by Plato) between mimesis and diegesis." (28). According to Formalist critics, this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work. The "occasion" of E. Montale is a further form of correlative.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.

Prompt: where does the chinatown bus stop in nyc
Ground truth: Often, ticket booths are walk-up windows on the street, or are located inside restaurants and bakeries throughout a given Chinatown community, although it is not uncommon for tickets to be sold on the street directly. Some lines even simply collect cash payment after passengers have boarded the bus. However, tickets are often sold online, either by the bus companies themselves or by portals and print-outs of confirmation emails are used as tickets. Except in Boston, the lines rarely use stations of their own. Passengers are usually directed to wait along a given curbside for the arrival of the bus, although many companies offer waiting areas at or near the pickup points. Several bus stops are also near major hotels and in the parking areas of major Chinese supermarkets. In New York, several bus lines pick up passengers on a stretch of Forsyth Street at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in the Little Fuzhou neighborhood within Manhattan's Chinatown. Since 1998, when the New York City Department of Transportation marked the strip a bus layover area, the sidewalk between Division Street and East Broadway has served as a de facto terminal for the Chinatown buses.

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.

2. The Crusades: During the Crusades, the practice of meditating on the Stations of the Cross became popular among the knights and soldiers who were away from their homes for long periods of time. They would often stop at designated stations along the way to pray and reflect on the Passion of Christ.
3. The Dominican Order: The Dominican Order, founded by St. Dominic in the 13th century, played a significant role in the development of the Stations of the Cross. They introduced the practice of meditating on each station in a specific order, which is still used today.

4. The Spanish Inquisition: In the 16th century
[0.335, 0.405, 0.201, 0.299, 0.634] Ori response: 

The Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or the Via Crucis, are a devotional practice in the Catholic Church that commemorates the passion and death of Jesus Christ. The origins of the Stations of the Cross can be traced back to the 14th century, when they were first established in Rome by the Franciscan friar, Br. Leonard of Port Maurice.

The idea of the Stations of the Cross was to provide a visual and spiritual guide for pilgrims visiting the sites in Jerusalem where Jesus was believed to have suffered and died. The original 14 stations were established based on the accounts of the passion of Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

Over time, the Stations of the Cross evolved and were standardized, with the addition of new stations and the modification of existing ones. The current 14 stations were established by Pope Pius VII in 1817, and have remained largely unchanged since then.

However, as you mentioned, not all of the stations have clear scriptural foundations. Stations 3, 4, 5

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.233, 0.346, 0.117, 0.240, 0.597] Agent refined response: the term "pop music" originated in the early 20th century, and it is believed to have come from the abbreviation of "popular music." The term was used to describe a genre of music that was popular among the masses, as opposed to classical music, which was considered more elite. Over time, the term "pop music" has evolved to encompass a wide range of styles and genres, including rock, hip-hop, electronic, and more.
[0.397, 0.442, 0.118, 0.214, 0.594] Ori response: Pop music, also known as popular music, has its roots in the early 20th century, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.304, 0.301, 0.084, 0.184, 0.557] Agent refined response: trigger points are located in the muscles and can be found in various areas of the body. These points are areas of muscle tissue that are painful or tender to the touch and can be associated with muscle imbalances, overuse injuries, or other musculoskeletal conditions. Trigger points are not located within the joints themselves, but rather in the muscles that surround and support the joints. The integrated hypothesis theory suggests that trigger points form due to excessive release of acetylcho line, which produces sustained depolarization  of muscle fibers, leading to muscle fatigue and pain. The biochemical composition of trigger points is also different from normal muscle tissue, with elevated concentrations of acetycline, noradrenaline, and serotonin and a decrease in pH levels. These sustained muscle contractions can compress local blood supply, restricting the energy needs of the affected region, leading to further muscle fatigue and pain.
[0.242, 0.268, 0.082, 0.171, 0.527] Ori response: trigger points are located in the muscles and can be found in various areas of the body. They are areas of muscle tissue that are painful or tender to the touch and can be associated with muscle imbalances, overuse or injury. Trigger points can be located in any muscle, but they are most commonly found in the muscles of the neck, back, arms, and legs.

Some common locations of trigger points include:

* The upper trapezius muscle, which can cause pain in the shoulder and neck areas
* The lower back muscles, which can cause pain in the lower back and hips
* The gluteal muscles, which can cause pain and stiffness in the hips and legs
* The quadriceps muscles in the thigh, which can cause knee pain and stiffness
* The pectoral muscles in the chest, which can cause chest pain and stiffness

It's important to note that trigger points can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle imbalances, overstretching or overuse, and injuries. They can also be associated with other conditions such as fibromyalgia

Whooping cough vaccination began in the early 1900s, with the first vaccine being developed in 1910. However, it was not until the 1930s that knowledge was gained about the bacteria's virulence and the importance of standardizing pre-inoculation handling practices. Today, it is established that at least some non-human primate species are susceptible to B. pertussis and can develop clinical whooping caugh in high incidence when exposed to  low inoculation doses. While the bacteria may be present iwild animal populations, this is not confirmed.

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.279, 0.297, 0.081, 0.194, 0.540] Agent refined response: the hormones of the anterior are created through the following steps:


1. Stress induces the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from the Hypothalamus.
2. CRH and vasopressin activate the release of adrenocorticoid-stimulating hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary Gland.
3. ACTH acts on the adrenal cortext to produce glucocorticoid such as cortisol.
4. Glucocorticoids act back to the anterior pituitary glands and the hypothalamus with a negative feedback to slow the production of CRH.

Therefore, the hormones of the anterior Pituitary are created through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is a complex neuroendocrine system that regulates the body's response to stress.
[0.243, 0.253, 0.074, 0.200, 0.541] Ori response: the hormones of the anterior  pituitary gland are created through the following process:

1. Stress: Stress operating through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the anterior pituitary glands has a large role in the neuropeptide system's stress response.
2. Release of hormones: Stress induces the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from the  hypothalamus, which activate the release of adrenocortocotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary Gland.
3. Production of glucocorticoids: The adrenal cortex then produces glucocorticoids such  as cortisol.
4. Negative feedback: These glucocorticoids act on the anterior pituitary Glands and the hypothalamus with  negative feedback to slow the production of CRH.

So, the hormones of the anterior Pituitary gland are created in the following way:

Prompt: who was the first signatory of the israeli declaration of independence
Ground truth: As leader of the Yishuv, David Ben-Gurion was the first person to sign. The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of Moetzet HaAm. However, twelve members could not attend, eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad. The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign, leaving spaces for those absent. Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner, Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column, leading to speculation that Vilner's name had been left alone to isolate him, or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration. However, Warhaftig later denied this, stating that a space had been left for him (as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically, but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father's memory and so moved down two spaces. He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories, and remained close for the rest of their lives. Of the signatories, two were women (Golda Meir (Meyerson/Myerson) and Rachel Cohen-Kagan).

Prompt: who won the nobel peace prize for 2017
Ground truth: The 2017 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) "for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition on such weapons," according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee announcement on October 6, 2017. The award announcement acknowledged the fact that "the world's nine nuclear-armed powers and their allies" neither signed nor supported the treaty-based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty, yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give "encouragement to all players in the field" to disarm. The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty, but drew criticism from those opposed. At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10, 2017, Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture.

Prompt: where does cleavage of the peptide bond by chymotrypsin occur
Ground truth: Chymotrypsin (EC 3.4. 21.1, chymotrypsins A and B, alpha-chymar ophth, avazyme, chymar, chymotest, enzeon, quimar, quimotrase, alpha-chymar, alpha-chymotrypsin A, alpha-chymotrypsin) is a digestive enzyme component of pancreatic juice acting in the duodenum where it performs proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides. Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side-chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine). These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a ' hydrophobic pocket ' (the S position) of the enzyme. It is activated in the presence of trypsin. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P sidechain and the enzyme S binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme. Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates, particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P position.
[0.000, 0.102, 0.011, 0.090, 0.548] Agent refined response: chymotrypsin facilitates the cleavage  of peptide bonds by hydrolysis reaction, which occurs in the digestive systems of  many organisms.
[0.020, 0.182, 0.041, 0.141, 0.564] Ori response: chymotrypsin facilitates the cleavage peptide bonds by a hydrolosis reaction, which despite being thermodynamic favorable occurs extremely slowly in the presence of a catalyst. Therefore, the cleavage of peptid bonds by chymotrypsin occurs in the digestive systems of various organisms.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).

Prompt: where did the beer hall putsch take place
Ground truth: The Beer Hall Putsch, also known as the Munich Putsch, and, in German, as the Hitlerputsch, Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch, Bürgerbräu-Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle, was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler--along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders--to seize power in Munich, Bavaria, during 8--9 November 1923. About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers. Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, Hitler was arrested and charged with treason.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.331, 0.351, 0.019, 0.161, 0.599] Agent refined response: 

Secretory cells of endocrine gland secrete their products through the following methods:

1. Merocrine secretion: Cells excrete their substances by exocyotis. For example, pancreatic acinar cell.
2. Apocrine secretion: A portion of the cell membrane that contain the excretion buds off
3. Holocrine secretion: The entire cell disintegrates to excreted its substance. For example, sebaceous gland of the skin and nose.
4. Serous cells secrete proteins, oten enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
5. Mucous cells secrete mucous. Examples include Brunner's glands, esphageal glands, and plyoric glands.
6. Mixed glands secrete both protein and Mucus. Examples include the salivary glands, although the Parotid gland 20% is predominantly serous.

Secretory cells of endocrine gland secrete their products through the following methods:

1. Exocytosis: This is the process of cells excreting their substances through the formation of vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the contents outside the cell. Endocrine cells, such as pancreatic acinar cells, use this method of secretion.
2. Apocrine secretion: In this process, a portion of the cell membrane containing the secretory buds off, releasing the contents outside of the cell. Holocrine secretion is a type of apocrine secretion where the entire cell disintegrates to release its substance. Examples of glands that use this method of secretion include sebaceous glands of skin and nose.

Prompt: a type of basic rock popular in the 1980s
Ground truth: By the late 1960s "classic rock" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and synth-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.

Prompt: where did the rulers of the qing dynasty originate
Ground truth: The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria. In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing "Banners", military-social units that included Jurchen, Han Chinese, and Mongol elements. Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity, which he renamed as the Manchus. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital, Beijing. Rather than serve them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and seized the capital. Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661--1722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia. The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their title was Emperor, they used "Bogd khaan" to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories.

Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.119, 0.176, 0.022, 0.110, 0.472] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, androgenetica, alopecia androgenetiva, and male pattern baldness (MPB), can be influenced by marital status in cross-sectional studies (NHANES 1). Additionally, animal models of androgenic baldness have been developed in transgenic rats, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bald uakaris (Cacajao rubicundus), and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca speciosa and M. arctoides). Of these, macaques have demonstrated androgenic alopecia.
[0.130, 0.227, 0.058, 0.156, 0.495] Ori response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, androgenetica, alopecia androgenetia, and male pattern baldness (MPB), can be influenced by marital status. In cross-sectional studies, marital status has been shown to have an impact on hair loss. However, it is important to note that one study may not be enough, as hair loss is a complex issue that can be influenced by multiple factors, including age.

Additionally, animal models of androgenic baldness have been developed in transgenic  mice, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bald uakaris (Cacajao rubicundus), and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca speciosa and M. arctoides). Of these, macaques have demonstrated that androgenic alopecia can occur naturally and have been developed in these animals.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.

Prompt: explain the function of the peripheral nervous system
Ground truth: The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two components of the nervous system, the other part is the central nervous system (CNS). The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood--brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon. Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS. The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.
[0.359, 0.504, 0.338, 0.371, 0.734] Agent refined response: 

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) plays a crucial role in connecting the central nervous system (CNS) to the rest of the body. Its primary function is to act as a relay between the brain and the limbs and organs, transmitting signals between them. The PNS is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the brain and motor signals from the brain to the muscles and glands. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebrate column and skull or the blood-brain barrier, which makes it more susceptible to external injuries and toxins. The PNS is divided into two subsystems: the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movements, and the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing.
[0.439, 0.472, 0.219, 0.280, 0.659] Ori response: 

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) plays a crucial role in regulating the body's autonomic functions, such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration. The PNS is responsible for transmitting signals between the central nervous system (CNS) and the rest of the body. It is composed of two main divisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.

The somatic nervous system is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the CNS and motor signals from the CNS to the muscles. It is involved in voluntary actions such as movement, sensation, and coordination.

On the other hand, the autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion breathing, and blood pressure. The autonomic nervous system is further divided into two subdivisions: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous systems.

The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the "fight or flight" response, which prepares the body for action by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. It is also involved in regulating stress responses and

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.127, 0.241, 0.092, 0.150, 0.584] Agent refined response: a dieback or population crash occurs when there is a decline in population densities following an overshoot. This decline can occur due to various factors such as lag effects, high reproduction rates relative to death rates, or severely affected ecosystems.
[0.260, 0.375, 0.127, 0.208, 0.603] Ori response: a dieback or population crash occurs when there is a decline in population densities following an overshoot, which is characterized by high reproduction rates relative to death rates, leading to an exponential growth in population size. This overgrowth eventually leads to a collapse or crash, causing a decline in population density.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.078, 0.287, 0.104, 0.226, 0.559] Agent refined response: cones are located in the following areas of the eye:

* They are much less numerous than rods and are found in most parts of the retina.
* However, they greatly outnumber rods in the  fovea.

So, the cones are located in the fovea region of the eye.
[0.064, 0.301, 0.105, 0.228, 0.564] Ori response: cones are located in the following areas of the eye:

* The fovea: Cones are greatly outnumbered rods in the fovea, which is the central part of the retina responsible for high-acuity vision.

So, the cones in the eye are located in the fovea.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.415, 0.331, 0.124, 0.184, 0.505] Agent refined response: the 3 layers of the meninge are:

1. Dura mater: The outermost layer of the meninges, characterized by a loosely arranged, fibroadastic layer of cells with multiple interdigitating cell processes, and significant extracellular space.

2. Endosteal layer: The inner layer of the meninges, which lies closest to the calvarium (skullcap).

3. Inner meningeal layer: The inner layer of meninges, which lies closer to the brain and contains larger blood vessels that split into capillaries in the pia mater

Prompt: when did the nba add the three point line
Ground truth: In the 1979--80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.
[0.284, 0.321, 0.104, 0.244, 0.555] Agent refined response: The NBA did not add the three-point line. The three-point line was first tested at the colleguate level in a 1944 NCAA game between Columbia and Fordham, but it was not kept as a rules. At the direction of Abe Saperstein, the American Basketball League became the first basketball league to instate the rule in 196 1. Its three-point line was a radius of  2 5 feet (7.62 m) from the baskets, except alon the sides. The Eastern Professional Basketball League followed in its footsteps.
[0.184, 0.388, 0.139, 0.233, 0.579] Ori response: The NBA did not add the three-point line. The three-point line was first introduced in the American Basketball League (ABL) in 1961, and later adopted by the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1979-80.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.367, 0.536, 0.362, 0.413, 0.718] Agent refined response: connective tissue is found throughout the body, including the nervous, skeletal, muscular, and circulatory systems. It is also found in other tissues, such as the skin, eyes, and membranes that line the internal organs. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which are the three outer membranes that envelop the brain and spine, are composed of connective tissue and support and protect the brain and spinal cord.
[0.464, 0.546, 0.310, 0.346, 0.674] Ori response: connective tissue is found throughout the body, including the nervous  system. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which are the three outer membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord, are composed of connective tissue and consist of elastic and collagenous fibres, ground substance, and cells.

Connective tissue is also found in other parts of the body, such as:

* Bones: Connective tissue holds bones together and provides support and structure.
* Muscles: Connective tissue connects muscle fibers and provides support and stability.
* Blood vessels: Connective tissue surrounds and supports blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries.
* Lymphatic system: Connective tissue forms the walls of lymph vessels and supports the immune system.

Prompt: what stage of the star life cycle is the sun in
Ground truth: The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star. The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases the pressure on the core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.354, 0.427, 0.064, 0.191, 0.586] Agent refined response: April Fools' Day is not a public holiday in Any country, and it is not a set day to end at noon. It is a day where people play practical jokes and spread hoaxes on April 1st. The jokes and their victims are known as April Fools, and people playing these jokes often expose their prank with the phrase "April Fool!" The custom of setting aside a day for playing practical jokes and spreading false information is not a formal or official tradition, but rather a cultural phenomenon that is observed in some European and Western countries.

Prompt: who is the new york state senate majority leader
Ground truth: There was a lengthy dispute over the leadership of the Senate during June and July 2009. On June 8, 2009, Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada, Jr., joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos. Following the precedent of 1913, the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario. Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer's resignation, the majority leaders (Bruno, Skelos and Smith) have acted as lieutenant governors. The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate, which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor. The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8. The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11, 2009. The dispute ended July 9, 2009, when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader, while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore, and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date. Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate, Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader, but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges. The current majority leader, or president, is John J. Flanagan.

Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

This verse is part of the Ten Commandments and is considered a fundamental principle of worship and reverence for God in the Jewish and Christian traditions. It is a prohibition of blasphony, or using God's name in a disrespectful or irreverent manner.

In Catholic theology, this commandment is understood as a prohibition against using God's name in a careless or disrespectful way, such as swearing or using God's name in an oath without proper reverence or intention. It is also seen as a reminder to treat God's name with the same reverence and respect as one would give to God himself.

Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".

No, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is not explicitly stated in the United States Constitution. However, it is a phrase that appears in the Declaration of Independence, which is a document that outlines the principles upon which the United States was founded. The Declaration of Independence states that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." While the Constitution does not explicitly mention these specific words, it does contain provisions that protect individual rights and freedoms, such as the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech and religion, and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses.

No, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is not explicitly stated in the United States Constitution. However, this phrase is found in the Declaration of Independence, which is a document adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and is not a legally binding document.

The Declaration of Independence states that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

While the Declaration of Independence is not a part of the Constitution, its principles and ideas have had a significant impact on the development of American law and society. The concept of unalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness, has been cited in numerous Supreme Court decisions and has influenced the interpretation of the Constitution.

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.

Chocolate originated in the Americas, not in Spain or Asia. The same pattern occurs in other foods that were enjoyed by both the natives and the Spanish during the time of Columbus' first encounter. While none of these other foods had a global demand similar to that of chocolate, it is known that chocolate originated in the Amercias.

Prompt: who was the first chief minister of west bengal
Ground truth: Since 1947, there have been eight Chief Ministers of West Bengal. The first was Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of the Indian National Congress, who was succeeded by his party-mates Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy and Prafulla Chandra Sen. A decade of instability followed, marred by fractious coalition governments and frequent impositions of President's rule. The instability ended with 1977 election victory of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). Headed by Jyoti Basu, the CPM-led Left Front government was in office for over 23 years (1977--2000). Left rule in West Bengal continued for another 10 years under Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, before its defeat in the 2011 election by the Trinamool Congress.

Prompt: what do the 3 dots mean in math
Ground truth: In logical argument and mathematical proof, the therefore sign (∴) is generally used before a logical consequence, such as the conclusion of a syllogism. The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read therefore. It is encoded at U + 2234 ∴ therefore (HTML & # 8756; &there4;). For common use in Microsoft Office hold the ALT key and type "8756". While it is not generally used in formal writing, it is used in mathematics and shorthand. It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.291, 0.318, 0.038, 0.178, 0.566] Agent refined response: 3 dots in a triangle shape are used to signify "therefore" in the 18th century. However, it's important to note that the meaning of the 3 dots in a triangle has evolved over time, and their usage has become less consistent. In the 19th century, the 3-dot notation for "therefore" became more common, particularly in the British Isles. In mathematical notation, the 3 dots are not commonly used to represent a specific mathematical operation. The 3 dots are typically used to indicate a conclusion or a logical inference, such as in a syllogism. For example, in the syllogism "All gods are immortal. Zeus is a god. Zeus is immortal. Therefore, all gods are immortal." The 3 dots are used to connect the conclusion to the premises.
[0.245, 0.288, 0.058, 0.173, 0.539] Ori response: 3 dots in a triangle shape, commonly referred to as "bullets" or "ellipses," have been used in mathematical notation to represent "therefore" or "that is to say."

In the 18th century, authors used the triangle-shaped dots to indicate "therefore" or "thus." However, there wasn't much consistency in how the triangle was oriented. The current meaning of the three-dot notation for "therefore" is believed to have originated in the 19th century.

In the 19th century, the use of the three-dot notation for 'therefore' became rare in continental Europe but remained popular in the British Isles.

For example, in a syllogism, the three dots could be used to indicate the conclusion of the argument, as in:

All gods are immortal.
Zeus is a god.
Zeus is immortal.

In this context, the three dots serve as a way to signal the conclusion of the argument and to indicate that the premises logically lead to the conclusion.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.242, 0.347, 0.106, 0.177, 0.595] Agent refined response: 

The term "dog and pony show" is a slang term that originated in the United States and is used to describe a variety show or entertainment program that is considered to be of poor quality or of little interest. The term is thought to have originated in the mid-20th century and was likely derived from the idea of a traveling circus or sideshow that featured a dog and a pony as the main attractions.

The term "dog and pony show" is believed to have originated in the United States in the mid-20th century. It is thought to have been used to describe a type of entertainment or variety show that featured a mix of acts, including dogs, ponies, and other animals. The term may have been used to suggest that the show was a less sophisticated or less serious form of entertainment, with the reference to "dog and pony" being a play on the idea of a "big show" or "spectacle."

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words"). The term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word.

Parole is an option for most prisoners, but it is not guaranteed, particularly for prisoners who are serving life or indeterminate prison sentences. Parole is the early release of a prisoner from prison, often after serving a portion of their sentence, on the condition that they will lead a law-abiding life and comply with certain rules and restrictions. In Canada, parole is granted by the National Parole Board, which considers a variety of factors, including the prisoner's conduct while in prison, their rehabilitation efforts, and the risk they pose to society.

Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.
[0.338, 0.407, 0.211, 0.284, 0.665] Agent refined response: 

The Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or the Via Crucis, are a series of images or representations that depict the events of the Passion of Jesus Christ. The stations are typically arranged in a specific order, with each station representing a different event in Jesus' journey to his crucifixion and death.
 The stations are often found in churches, chapels, and other religious buildings, and are used as a devotional aid for Christians to meditate on the Passion of Jesus. The origins of the stations of the Cross can be traced back to the early Christian Church, with the first recorded use of the stations dating back to the 4th century. The practice of using images or representations of the stations became more widespread in the Middle Ages, particularly in Europe.

Some modern liturgists say the traditional Stations of the Cross are incomplete without a final scene depiction the empty tomb and/or the resurrection of Jesus, because Jesus' rising from the dead was an integral part his salvific work on earth.

Advocates of the traditional form of the Stations ending with the body of Jesus being placed in the tomb say the Stations are intended as a meditation on atoning death of
[0.285, 0.347, 0.116, 0.224, 0.573] Ori response: 

The stations of the cross are a traditional Catholic devotion that commemorates the passion and death of Jesus Christ. The devotion originated in the 12th century and has evolved over time, with different versions emerging in various countries. The 14 traditional stations of the cross were established in the 15th century by a Dominican priest, Father Thomas of Celano, and have been widely adopted by the Catholic Church.

The scriptural basis for the stations of the cross is limited, with only eight of the 14 stations having clear scriptural foundations. Stations 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 are not specifically attested to in the Bible. Instead, the devotion relies on a combination of biblical references, early Christian traditions, and the writings of early Church Fathers.

The stations of the cross were originally based on the accounts of the Passion of Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The devotion gradually expanded to include additional elements, such as the suffering of Jesus' mother, Mary, and the role of other figures

Therefore, John Locke had a significant influence on the Declaration of Independence.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.253, 0.231, 0.069, 0.154, 0.514] Agent refined response: 

A limit of a function does not exist in the following cases:

1. As special cases, limits on an interval: A limit does not exist if the function is not defined on the entire interval or if the function is not continuous on the entire interval.
2. Left-hand limits of real-valued functions: A limit does not exist if s is an open interval of the form (−∞,a), where a is a real number.
3. Right-hand limits of real-valuED functions: A limit does not exist If s is an open interval of the forma (a,∞), where a is a real number
4. One-sided limits at included endpoints: A limit does not exist if x approaches the included endpoint of a half-closed interval from below.
[0.213, 0.268, 0.085, 0.148, 0.519] Ori response: 

A limit of a function does not exist in the following cases:

1. Special cases of limits on an interval: Limits do not exist for functions on certain intervals, such as left-hand limits of real-valued functions (e.g., by taking $s$ to be an open interval of the forms $(-\infty,a)$ or $(a,\infty)$) and right-hand limits (e.g., by taking$s$ to be an open interval such as $(a, \infty)$ or $(-\infty,a)$).
2. Included endpoints of closed intervals: The limit of a function does not exist as $x$ approaches $0$ from above when the interval is closed on the right side, but not on the left side. For example, the square root function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ has a limit of $0$ as $x$ approaches $0$, but only from the right side.
3. Deleted versus non-deleted limits: The concept of one-sided limits is extended to include the included endpoints of closed intervals. This means that the limit of a function may not exist if the interval is deleted, but it may exist

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

Prompt: how long is training camp for nfl players
Ground truth: In the National Football League, training camp refers to the time before the season commences. During this time, teams will sometimes congregate at an outside location, usually a university, to conduct training camp for at least the first few weeks. This is similar to baseball's spring training.
[0.163, 0.238, 0.030, 0.119, 0.540] Agent refined response: NFL training camps typically last for several weeks, with the exact duration varying from team to team. However, the general consensus is that training camp usually lasts for 4-6 weeks.

For example, the Jacksonville Jaguars' training camp is scheduled to begin on July 25th and end on August 22nd, spanning a period of 3 weeks. Similarly, the New England Patriots' training camp is set to run from July 27th to August  26th, lasting for 3 weeks as well.


It is worth noting that some teams may hold additional practice sessions during the exhibition season, which typically begins in late August or early September. These additional practice sessions are referred to as "two-a-days," where teams hold two practice sessions on the same day.

Overall, the duration and structure of NFL training camps can vary depending on the team and the league's rules, but the general outline is similar across all teams.
[0.242, 0.231, 0.039, 0.135, 0.518] Ori response: NFL training camps typically last for 4-5 weeks, with the first week being more of a conditioning camp and the last week being more focused on exhibition games. The exact duration of training camp may vary depending on the team and the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA).

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.753, 0.805, 0.611, 0.755, 0.888] Agent refined response: Bullets fired into the air usually fall with terminal velocities much lower than the muzzle velocity when they leave a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured or fatally when bullets discharged into air fall back down to the ground, despite the terminal velocity. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical maintain their ballistic trajectory and are less likely to engage in tumble motion, so they travel at speeds much higher than a falling bullet.
[0.358, 0.456, 0.301, 0.377, 0.733] Ori response: Bullets fired into the air usually fall with terminal velocities much lower than the muzzle velocity when they leave a firearm's barrel. Nevertheless, people can be injured or even killed when bullets fired into the air fall back down to earth.

However, the terminal velocity of a bullet fired into the air depends on various factors, including the weight and size of the bullet, the air density, and the angle of the shot. Generally, the heavier and larger the bullet, the lower its terminal velocity.

It is important to note that even if the bullet falls back to the ground with a lower velocity than when it left the barrel, it can still cause significant damage or injury if it hits a person or object. Therefore, it is crucial to handle firearms safely and responsibly, especially when firing shots into the air.

[0.189, 0.173, 0.031, 0.102, 0.467] Agent refined response: 

China's holdings of government bonds, as a percentage of all foreign-held government bonds, have increased significantly since 2000. In 2000, China held just 6% of all foreign-held U.S. Treasury securities. However, the exact amount of the United States' debt to China is not publicly disclosed. The U.S. Treasury Department does not release information on the holdings of individual foreign governments. However, as of September 2014, China was the largest single holder of U.S. government debt, holding 21% of all foreign-held Treasury securities (10% of total U.S. public debt).
[0.117, 0.146, 0.016, 0.073, 0.451] Ori response: 

China's holdings of government in the United States as a percentage of all foreign-held government debt are up significantly since the year 2000. Specifically, as of 2020, China held 19.3% of all foreign-held U.S. Treasury securities, up from 6% in 2000.

However, it is essential to note that China's holdings of U.S. government debt are not the only source of potential financial or political risk for the United States. The country's high public debt, which currently stands at over $23 trillion, or around 100% of GDP, poses significant risks to the economy, including the potential for higher interest rates, inflation, and reduced economic growth.

Additionally, the United States' large and growing trade deficit with China, which has contributed to the country's high public debt levels, poses significant risks to both the U.S. and Chinese economies.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.183, 0.207, 0.045, 0.148, 0.509] Agent refined response: Trigger points are located in the muscles of the body, particularly in the skeletal muscles that control movement and posture.

2. Back muscles: Trigger points in these muscles can cause pain and stifferness in the back, as well as radiating pain down the arms or legs.
3. Chest muscles: Trigger points in chest muscles can cause pain and discomfort in the chest, shoulders, and arms.
4. Abdominal muscles: Trigger points in abdominal muscles can cause pain and disability in the abdomen, as well as referred pain to the lower back and legs.
5. Lower extremity muscles: Trigger points in muscles of the lower extremities, such as the calf, hamstring, and quadriceps, can cause pain and discomfort down the legs.
6. Pelvic muscles: Trigger points in pel
[0.215, 0.262, 0.073, 0.153, 0.544] Ori response: Trigger points are located in the muscles of the body. More specifically, they are areas of taut, overactive muscle tissue that can be felt as a knot or lump under the skin. These areas are characterized by a localized increase in muscle tone and spasm, which can cause pain and discomfort in the affected area.

The location of trigger points in the body varies depending on the muscle involved. However, they are most commonly found in the muscles of the neck, back, arms, and legs. Some common locations for trigger points include:

* Neck: trigger points in the neck muscles can cause pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and upper back.
* Back: trigger points in the back muscles can cause pain and stifness in the lower back, upper back, and shoulders.
* Arms: trigger points in the arm muscles can cause pain and weakness in the arm, hand, or fingers.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.337, 0.455, 0.195, 0.284, 0.639] Agent refined response: 

The phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is not in the United States Constitution. However, the idea of unalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness, is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, which is a foundational document of the United States. The Declaration states that these rights are given to all human beings by the Creator and are protected by government.
[0.368, 0.399, 0.153, 0.232, 0.613] Ori response: 

The phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is not in the United States Constitution. However, these words are found in the Declaration of Independence, which is a document adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, declaring the independence of the United States from Great Britain.

The Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, states that "all men are created equal" and are endowed with certain "unalienable rights," including "life, liberty, and the means of acquiring and possessing property." These rights are believed to be inherent to all human beings and are the foundation of the American political philosophy.

The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.415, 0.382, 0.114, 0.240, 0.581] Agent refined response: 

The term "pop music" originated in the early 1950s, as a shorthand for "popular music." It was initially used to describe a style of music that was commercially successful and widely enjoyed, but it has since become a catch-all term for a wide range of styles and genres. The term "pop" is derived from the word "popular," which was used to describe music that was popular or fashionable at a particular time or place. The term "pop music" was first used in the early 1952 issue of Billboard magazine, where it was used to describe a new style of music that was emerging at the time. This style was characterized by catchy melodies, simple harmonies, and a focus on vocal performance. Over time, the term "pop music" has come to encompass a wide range of styles and genes, including rock, R&B, hip-hop, and electronic music.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.330, 0.329, 0.093, 0.211, 0.532] Agent refined response: 

The hormones of the anterior pitutary gland are created through the following process:

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).

Ground truth: The Beer Hall Putsch, also known as the Munich Putsch, and, in German, as the Hitlerputsch, Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch, Bürgerbräu-Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle, was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler--along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders--to seize power in Munich, Bavaria, during 8--9 November 1923. About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers. Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, Hitler was arrested and charged with treason.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.134, 0.338, 0.109, 0.231, 0.597] Agent refined response: 

A dieback or population crash occurs when the rate of reproduction is higher than the death rate, leading to an increase in population density, which can cause overshoot and ultimately result in a decline in population density.
[0.327, 0.329, 0.107, 0.212, 0.608] Ori response: 

A dieback or population crash occurs when a population experiences a decline in population density due to overshoot. This can happen when reproduction rates remain high relative to the death rate, leading to an increase in population size. However, if the population grows too quickly, it can lead to a decline in population density due a shortage of resources, such as food, water, or habitat. This decline in population density can result in a dieback or crash.

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.

Prompt: what's the difference between salisbury steak and hamburger steak
Ground truth: Salisbury steak is a dish made from a blend of ground beef and other ingredients and is usually served with gravy or brown sauce. Hamburg steak is a similar product but differs in ingredients.
[0.153, 0.267, 0.145, 0.226, 0.672] Agent refined response: 

Salisbury steak and hamburger Steak are very similar dishes. Salisbury steak is a dish made from ground beef, usually minced or finely chopped, mixed with seasonings, and formed into patties or loaves. Hamburger steak is a dish made with ground beef, usually minced, mixed with seasonings, and cooked in a pan or oven.

However, there are some differences between the two dishes. Salisbury steaks are typically made with a mixture of ground beef and pork, while hamburger steak is made with only ground beef. Salisbury steak is also more commonly served with gravy or sauce, while hamburger steak may be served with a variety of condiments and toppings.

It is worth noting that the term "hamburger" can refer to a wide range of dishes that are not necessarily made with the same ingredients or cooking methods as traditional hamburgers. In some cases, the term "hamburger" may be used to refer to a dish that is more similar to a salisbury steack.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

[0.435, 0.394, 0.048, 0.165, 0.563] Ori response: 
April Fools' Day is not a public holiday in a country, so it does not have a specific end time. The custom of setting aside a day for playing practical jokes and spreading pranks is not a formal or official tradition, so there is no designated time frame for it to end. 

In general, the day is celebrated on April 1st of every year, and people engage in various pranks and jokes throughout the day. The tradition of shouting "April Fools!" at the unfortunate victims of the pranks is a common feature of the day. 

It is worth noting that some newspapers, magazines, and other published media may report fake stories on this day, but these are usually explained the next day or placed in smaller letters below the news section.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.379, 0.459, 0.231, 0.294, 0.643] Agent refined response: 

Connective tissue is found throughout the body, including the nervous and circulatory systems. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which envelop the brain and spinal column, are composed of connective tissue and provide support and protection.

In other parts of the body, connective tissue is found in the following places:

1. Blood vessels: Connective tissue wraps around blood vessels to keep them in place and to secure them to surrounding tissues.
2. Lymphatic system: The lymphatic system, which helps the body eliminate waste and excess fluids, is supported by connective tissue.
3. Joints: Cartilage, a type of connective tissue, is found in joints and helps to absorb shock and keep bones in place.
4. Tendons: Tendons, which connect muscles to bones, are made of connective tissue.
5. Eye: The cornea, iris, and retina are all made of connective tissue in the eye.
6. Skin: Connective tissue underlies the skin and helps to hold it in place.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.148, 0.263, 0.114, 0.200, 0.605] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss due to the presence of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in their bodies. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in the hair follicles.

As men age, the levels of DHT in their bodies increase, leading to a gradual shrinking of the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. This condition is inherited, and the risk of developing male pattern baldness increases with age.

Other factors, such as family history, genetics, stress, and certain medical conditions, can also contribute to hair loss. Marital status has been shown in some cross-sectional studies to influence hair loss, with married men experiencing less hair loss than unmarried men.
[0.170, 0.289, 0.160, 0.224, 0.661] Ori response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss due to a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. It is caused by the gradual reduction of hair follicles in the frontal and vertex areas of the scalp, leading to thinning and eventual baldness.

While the exact causes of male pattern baldness are not fully understood, it is believed to be linked to the presence of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in the hair follicles. As men age, the amount of DHT in their bodies increases, leading to a gradual reduction in hair growth and eventual baldness.

Prompt: the elements in each period have the same number of
Ground truth: A period in the periodic table is one of the horizontal rows, all of those elements have the same number of electron shells. Going across a period, each element has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. Arranged this way, groups of elements in the same column have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the alkali metals lie in the first column (group 1) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.244, 0.298, 0.013, 0.174, 0.591] Agent refined response: 

Secretory cells of endocrine gland excrete their products through the following mechanisms:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, including enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin. Examples include Brunner's glands, esphageal glands, and plyoric glands.

3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucin. Examples include the salivary glands, although the parotid gland is predominantly serous.
[0.323, 0.351, 0.034, 0.167, 0.598] Ori response: 

Secretory cells of endocrine gland secrete their products through the following methods:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, such as enzymes, through exocytosis. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin, a type of mucus, through exocytosis. Example includes mucous cells in the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract.
3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucus through exocytosis. Examles include the salivary glands, such as the parotid gland, which secretes 20% of its product as serous cells and the rest as mucous cells.
4. Apocrine secretion, a portion of the cell membrane containing excretion buds off. This method is seen in cells such as sweat glands and sebaceous glands of skin and nose.
5. Holocrine secretion, the entire cell disintegrates to secrete its product. This method is seen in cells, such as the seb

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.333, 0.308, 0.114, 0.205, 0.515] Agent refined response: 

The three layers of the meninges are:

1. Dura mater (tough mother) - the outermost layer, a thick, durable membrane closest to the skull and vertebral column. It is characterized by multiple interdigitating fiber processes, no extracellular collage, and significant permeability.
2. Arachnoid mater (spider-like mother) - the middle layer, a delicate, mesh-like membrane. It is composed of thin, branching fibers, and is richly supplied with sensory nerve endings.
3. Pia mater (delicate mother) - the innermost layer, a thin, delicate membrane closely adherent to the surface of the brain and spinal cord. It is composed of flattened cells, and forms a close apposition with the surface of the neural tissue.
[0.282, 0.308, 0.118, 0.200, 0.538] Ori response: 

The meninges are divided into four layers:

1. Dura mater (outermost layer): A thick, durable membrane closest to the skull and vertebral column. It is composed of a loosely arranged, fibrosa layer of cells with multiple interdigitating cell processes, little extracellular collagen, or significant vascularization.
2. Arachnoid mater (middle layer): A delicate, web-like membrane that covers the surface of the brain and spinal cord. It is composed of collagenous fibers, with a loose arrangement of cells and a rich blood supply.
3. Pia mater (innermost layer): A thin, delicate membrane that closely adheres to the surface of the brain and spinals cord. It is composed of delicate, collagenous fibers and is highly vascularized.
4. Leptomeninges (inner most layer): A delicate, branching network of meningeal vessels that cover the surface of the brain and spina cord.

The meninges play a crucial role in protecting the central nervous system by acting as a mechanical barrier, maintaining

Prompt: when was the biltmore house opened to the public
Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism. Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.
[0.389, 0.354, 0.091, 0.206, 0.575] Agent refined response: 

The religion in the Virginia colony was primarily Anglicanism, which was the established religion of the colony. The Anglican Church was the official church of the colony, and its clergy were appointed by the British government. The colonists were required to attend church services and to pay taxes to support the church. However, following the American Revolution, many of the Anglican clergy went into exile, and the local vestry no longer distributed church funds or had local government functions such as providing poor relief.

In 1790, the first Episcopal bishop of Virginia, the Reverend James Madison, was appointed to rebuild the denomination within the colony. This was done with the principle of freedom of choice of belief and worship, allowing individuals to choose their own religious beliefs and practices.
[0.275, 0.285, 0.053, 0.179, 0.531] Ori response: 

The religion in the Virginia colony was predominantly Anglican or Church of England, which was the official state church of England at the time. The colony was established by British settlers who were primarily members of the Church of England, and they brought their religious beliefs and practices with them to the New World. The Anglican Church was the established church in Virginia, and its clergy were appointed by the British government.

However, the colony also had a significant number of dissenters, including Puritans, Baptists, and Quakers, who were not members of the Church of England and faced persecution and discrimination as a result. These groups were not allowed to hold public office or to vote unless they conformed to the established religion.

Over time, some colonists began to question the authority of the Church of England and to seek greater religious freedom. In 1776, the Virginia Declaration of Rights included a statement of religious freedom, which was later incorporated into the United States Constitution. This led to the separation of church and state in Virginia and the freedom to practice any religion without interference from the government.

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.
[0.007, 0.180, 0.061, 0.150, 0.502] Agent refined response: 

Chocolate originated in the Americas, but its popularity and global demand were not as high as it was in Spain.
[0.315, 0.368, 0.095, 0.195, 0.588] Ori response: 

Chocolate originated in the Americas, but it was first introduced to Spain and later became popular in Europe.

The origins of chocolate can be traced back to the ancient Mayan and Aztec civilizations in Central and South America, where cacao beans were cultivated and used as a form of currency. The beans were also used to make a bitter, frothy drink that was believed to have medicinal and spiritual properties.

After the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas in 1492, chocolate was introduced to Spain and quickly became popular among the Spanish aristocracy. From there, it spread throughout Europe, becoming a luxury item enjoyed by the wealthy and the royal courts.

Over time, chocolate production techniques and flavor profiles evolved, with the addition of sugar, milk, and other ingredients to create the smooth, creamy chocolate that is enjoyed today. However, the origins of chocolate can still be traced back to the ancient civilizations of the Americas, where it was first cultivated and enjoyed.

Prompt: what inspired huxley to write brave new world
Ground truth: Huxley said that Brave New World was inspired by the utopian novels of H.G. Wells, including A Modern Utopia (1905) and Men Like Gods (1923). Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novel, which became Brave New World. He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had "been having a little fun pulling the leg of H.G. Wells," but then he "got caught up in the excitement of (his) own ideas." Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to Brave New World as a "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own The Sleeper Awakes (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D.H. Lawrence.
[0.503, 0.476, 0.151, 0.254, 0.630] Agent refined response: 

Huxley was inspired to write Brave New World by several factors, including:

1. The optimistic utopian novels of the early 20th century, such as Wells's The Sleeper Awakes (1900) and Lawrence's The Man Who Died (1929). These novels explored the idea of a future society that had overcome many of the problems of the present, but Huxley wanted to challenge this idea by creating a dystopian vision of the future.
2. The influence of other authors, such as Wells and Zamyatin. Orwell believed that Brave New World must have been partly derived from the latter's novel We (1924), which explored themes of totalitarianism and the loss of individual freedom.
3. Huxley's own ideas and interests, particularly his concerns about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the manipulation of human behavior through conditioning. He saw his novel as a way to explore these themes in a fictional setting, rather than as a straightforward critique or prediction.
[0.404, 0.421, 0.177, 0.204, 0.626] Ori response: 

Huxley was inspired to write Brave New World by several factors, including:

1. H.G. Wells's The Sleeper Awakes: Huxley was influenced by Wells's own utopian novel, which dealt with themes of corporate tyranny and behavioral conditioning.
2. D.H. Lawrence's works: Huxley was also influenced by the works of D.H. Lawrence, particularly his novel The Man Who Died, which explored themes of sexuality and individuality.
3. Yevgeny Zamytin's novel We: George Orwell believed that Brave New World must have been partly derived from Zamytin's novel, which dealt with thems of a future society where people are genetically engineered and conditioned to be happy and conform to society.

These works influenced Huxley's vision of a dystopian future, where people are controlled through pleasure and conditioning, rather than through violence or coercion.

Prompt: where is arachidonic acid found in the body
Ground truth: Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides) of membranes of the body's cells, and is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. Skeletal muscle is an especially active site of arachidonic acid retention, accounting for roughly 10-20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content on average.
[0.229, 0.291, 0.077, 0.190, 0.588] Agent refined response: 

Arachidonic acid is found in the body in several sources:

1. Commercial source: A commercial source of arachidonic has been derived from the fungus Mortierella alpina.
2. Eicosanoid synthesis: Arachidonic acid is generated through the cascade of eicosanoid synthesis in humans.
3. Phospholipase A2 (PLA): Arachidonic acid is freed by the enzyme phosphatidylcholine from a phospholipid by the enzyme phosphotidylcholine.
4. Group VA cytosolic phosphatidylcholine (CPLA): Arachidonic acid generated for signal purposes appears to be derived by the Group VA cytosolal phosphatidylcholine.
5. Low-molecular-weight secretory phosphatidylcholine: Inflammatory arachidonic is generated by the action of a Low-molecular-weight Secretory phosphatidylcholin.
[0.197, 0.230, 0.058, 0.149, 0.566] Ori response: 

A commercial source of arachidonic has been derived from the fungus Mortierella alpina. In humans, arachidonic acid is generated through the following pathway:

1. Eicosanoid synthesis: Arachidonic acid is freed by the enzyme phosphatidylserine (PS) by the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE).
2. Phospholipase A2 (PLA): Arachidonic acid is released from a phospholipid by the enzyme phosphorylase A2 (PLA), which cleaves off the fatty Acid, but can also be generated from diacylglycerol lipases.
3. Group VA cytosolic phosphatidylserine: Arachidonic acid generated for signal transduction purposes appears to be derived by the actions of group VA cytosolic PLA (CPLA, 85 kDa), whereas inflammatory arachdonic acid is generated by the action low molecular weight secretory PLA (SPLA, 14-18 kDa).
