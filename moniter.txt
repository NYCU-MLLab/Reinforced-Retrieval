Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

The term has since been used more broadly to refer to any kind of show or presentation that is perceived as lacking in substance or coherence.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words"). The term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word.
[0.000, 0.138, 0.509] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, if a prisoner is sentenced to serve no less than 2 years, they will be sent to a federal correction facility. Parole is an option for most prisoners, but it is not guaranteed, particularly for prisoners serve life or indeterminate sentences (KNOW).

In cases of first-degree murder, a prisoner can apply for parole after 12 years if convicted of a single homicide. However, if convicted of multiple murder, the sentencing judge has the option of making parole ineligibility periods sequential, extending parole ineligibility for more than 25 years, and in rare cases, beyond that (KNOW).

Therefore, being on parole means that the prisoner has been released from prison on conditional release, subject to certain conditions and supervision by a parole officer, after serving a portion of their sentence. The parolee must comply with these conditions and demonstrate that they are ready to reintegrate into society before their parole can be granted.

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.
[0.067, 0.202, 0.585] Agent refined response: The origins of the Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, can be traced back to the early Christian Church. The practice of meditating on the Passion of Jesus Christ through the stations of the cross became popular in the Middle Ages, particularly during the Crusades.

The exact origin of the Stations of the Cross is unclear, but it is believed to have originated in Jerusalem during the 4th or 5th century. According to tradition, a devout Christian named Egeria, who traveled to the Holy Land in the 4th century, wrote about visiting the sites where Jesus was crucified, buried, and resurrected. Her account includes a description of a path of 14 stations, which became the basis for the modern Stations of the Cross.

The Stations of the Cross gained popularity throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, particularly during Lent. The practice of meditating at each station became a way for Christians to reflect on the suffering and death of Jesus and to prepare for Easter.

The traditional 14 stations of the cross are:

1. Jesus is condemned to death by Pontius Pilate
2. Jesus is scourged and crowned with thorns
3. Jesus carries his cross
4. Jesus meets his mother, Mary
5. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross
6. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus
7. Jesus falls the first time
8. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem
9. Jesus falls the second time
10. Jesus is stripped of his clothes
11. Jesus is nailed to the cross
12. Jesus dies on the cross
13. Jesus is taken down from the cross
14. Jesus is placed in the tomb

Over time, the Stations of the Cross have evolved, and some variations have emerged. For example, some churches have additional stations, such as the resurrection of Jesus, which is not part of the traditional 14 stations. Additionally, some stations may be rearranged or reworded to better reflect the local culture or tradition.

Despite these variations, the Stations of the Cross remain an important part of Christian devotion and a powerful way for believers to meditate on the Passion of Jesus Christ.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.048, 0.167, 0.549] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, a limit of a function does not exist in the following situations:

1. As $s$ approaches an open interval of the form $(-\infty,a)$, the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$ does not exist.
2. As $s$ approaches anopen interval of the form $(a, \infty)$, the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$ doesnot exist.
3. When $x$ approaches a half-closed interval from the included endpoint, the limit of a function $f(x)$ does no exist.

For example, the limit of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right does not exist, because the function has different limits as $x$ approaches $0+$ and $x$ approaches $0-$.

In general, the limit of a function $ f(x) $ as $x$ approaches $a$ does not exist if $f(x)$ is not defined at $a$, or if the function has different limits as $ x $ approaches $a$ from different directions.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.332, 0.561, 0.804] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, bullets fired into the air usually return to the ground with terminal velocities much lower than the muzzle velocity when they leave a firearm. However, people can still be injured or killed if the bullets fall back down to the ground, even if they have a lower terminal velocity. This is because bullets fired at angles less than perpendicular to the ground maintain their angular ballistic trajectory and travel at speeds much higher than a falling bullet, making them more dangerous.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.000, 0.171, 0.565] Agent refined response: Trigger points are located in the muscles and connective tissue throughout the body. They are areas of muscle tissue that are characterized by hypersensitivity and spasm, and can cause pain and discomfort in the surrounding area. Trigger points can be found in any muscle, but they are most commonly found in the muscles of the neck, back, shoulders, and lower extremities.

There are several ways to locate trigger points in the body, including:

1. Palpation: This involves feeling the muscle for areas of tenderness or spasm.
2. Imaging: Imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans can help identify areas of muscle inflammation or degeneration that may be causing trigger points.
3. Myofascial release: This is a technique that involves applying gentle pressure to the muscle to release tension and relax the trigger point.
4. Trigger point injections: This involves injecting a local anesthetic or steroid into the trigger point to help relax the muscle and reduce pain.

It's important to note that trigger points can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle overuse or injury, poor posture, and nerve irritation. Treating trigger points can help alleviate pain and improve muscle function, but it's important to address the underlying cause of the trigger point as well.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.134, 0.282, 0.641] Agent refined response: Yes, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is mentioned in the United States Declaration of Independence, which is a document adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The Declaration is not a part of the United States Constitution, but it is a foundational document that influenced the writing of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The Declaration states that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." This phrase has been interpreted to mean that individuals have inherent rights that cannot be taken away by any government or authority, and that these rights include the right to life, liberty, freedom of thought and expression, and the pursuit of happiness.

The Constitution does not explicitly mention the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness," but it does contain provisions that protect these rights, such as the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which states that "no person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to protect the right to life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.000, 0.193, 0.530] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the hormones of the anteriorpituitary gland are created through the following process:

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.000, 0.169, 0.574] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, the secretory cells of endocrore glands secrete their products through the following mechanisms:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, including enzymes, through exocytosis. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin, a type of mucus, through exocytosis.Examples include Brunner's glands, esaphageal glands, and plyoric glands.
3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucus through exocytosis. Exampes include the salivary glands, with the parotid gland being 20% serous.
4. Holocrine secretion occurs when a portion of the cell membrane containing the excretion buds off, releasing the substance from the cell. This mechanism is not mentioned in the provided knowledge.
5. Apocrine secretion occurs when a part of the cell membrane detaches, releasing the substance. This mechanism is not mentioned in he provided knowledge.

In summary, the secretory cells of endoccrine glands secrete their products through exocytosis, with the exception of holocrine and apocrine secretion, which are not mentioned in the provided knowledge.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.030, 0.135, 0.591] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common form of hair loss that affects men. It is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. The genetic component is thought to be inherited from one's parents, while the hormonal component is related to the presence of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced in the body and is known to contribute to hair loss.

Research has shown that the risk of developing male pattern baldness increases with age, with the majority of cases occurring in men over the age of 30. Marital status has also been shown to influence hair loss in cross-sectional studies (NHANES 1).

In addition to genetic and hormonal factors, other factors such as stress, certain medical conditions, and certain medications can also contribute to hair loss. It's important to note that male pattern baldness is a common condition and affects millions of men worldwide.

Animal models of androgenic alopcia have been developed in transgenicmice, chimpanzees, bald uakaris, and stump-tailed macaques. Of these, macaques have demonstrated that DHT can cause hair loss by shrinking the hair follicles and reducing the growth of new hair.

In summary, male pattern baldness is caused by a combination of genetics and hormonal factors, and the risk of developing it increases with age. While stress, medical conditions, and certain medications may also contribute to hair loss, the underlying cause is the presence of DHT in the body.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.000, 0.190, 0.574] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, a dieback or population crash occurs when the rate of reproduction is high relative to the death rate, leading to an overshoot in population growth. This can happen when there are lag effects, meaning that the population growth is not immediately limited by the available resources, leading to an overexploitation of the resources and a subsequent collapse of the population.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.026, 0.225, 0.559] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, cones are located in the following areas of the eye:

* The fovea: Cones are greatly outnumbered by rods in most parts of the Retina, but they are much more numerous in the fovea.
* The periphery: Cones are less numerous than rods in most areas of the Retina, but they outnumber rods in the fovia.

So, the cones are located in the fovea and the periphery of the eye.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.218, 0.486, 0.721] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, connective tissue is found throughout the body, including in the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which are the three outer membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord, are composed of connective tissue and consist of elastic and collagenous fibres, ground substance, and cells.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.000, 0.182, 0.558] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, April Fools' Day is not a public holiday inany country, and there is no specific time when it ends. The day is simply a day when people in some European and Western countries commemorate by playing practical jokes and spread hoaxes, and the pranks are usually exposed by shouting "April Fool!" at the unfortunate victim. Newspapers, magazines, and other published media may also report fake stories, which are usually revealed the next day or in smaller letters below the news section.

HBO is known for producing high-quality, critically acclaimed shows with complex storylines and character development, which often require more time and resources to produce. As a result, HBO shows tend to have shorter seasons compared to network TV shows, which often have longer seasons to accommodate more advertising time and a larger audience.

The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.
[0.093, 0.255, 0.638] Agent refined response: The origins of the Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, can be traced back to the early Christian Church. The practice of meditating on the Passion of Jesus Christ through the stations of the cross became popular in the Middle Ages, particularly during the Crusades.

The first recorded use of the Stations of the Cross was in the 12th century by the Cistercian monks in Jerusalem. They created a series of 14 stations along the Via Dolorosa, the route believed to have been taken by Jesus during his trial, scourging, and crucifixion. The stations were designed to help pilgrims meditate on the events of Jesus' Passion and to relive his suffering.

The practice of the Stations of the Cross then spread throughout Europe, particularly in Italy and Spain, where it became an important part of the devotional life of the Catholic Church. The stations were often located in churches, monasteries, and other religious institutions, and were typically marked by a series of plaques or sculptures depicting the various scenes of the Passion.

Over time, the number of stations in the Stations of the Cross has varied, with some traditions using as few as seven or as many as 17 stations. The traditional  number of stations, however, is 14, which corresponds to the number of stations along the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem.

In addition to their religious significance, the Stations of the Cross have also played an important role in the cultural and artistic heritage of Europe. Many famous artists, including Michelangelo, Bernini, and Caravaggio, have created works of art inspired by the stations of the cross, and the practice of meditating on thePassion of Jesus has become an integral part of Catholic devotional life.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.051, 0.173, 0.545] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, a limit of a function does not exist in the following situations:

1. As $s$ approaches an open interval of the form $(-\infty,a)$, the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$ does not exist.
2. As $s$ approaches anopen interval of the form $(a, \infty)$, the limit of a real- valued function $f(x)$ doesnot exist.
3. When $x$ approaches a half-closed interval from the included endpoint, the limit of a function $f(x)$ does  not exist.

For example, the limit of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right does not exist, because the function has different limits as $x$ approaches $0+$ and $x$ approaches $0-$.

In general, the limit of a function $ f(x) $ as $x$ approaches $a$ does not exist if the function has different limits as $ x $ approaches $a$ from different directions.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.

They are areas of muscle tissue that are characterized by hypersensitivity and spasm, and can cause pain in a localized or referred manner. Trigger points can be located in any muscle, but they are most commonly found in the muscles of the neck, back, arms, and legs.

Some common locations for trigger points include:

* Neck and shoulder muscles: Trigger points in the neck and shoulder muscles can cause pain in the shoulder, arm, and hand.
* Back muscles: Trigger points in these muscles can cause pain in the back, as well as in the legs and buttocks.
* Chest muscles: Trigger points in this area can cause pain in the chest, shoulder, and arm.
* Abdominal muscles: Trigger points in abdominal muscles can cause pain in the abdomen, back, and legs.
* Lower leg muscles: Trigger points in muscles of the lower leg can cause pain in the knee, ankle, and foot.

It's important to note that trigger points can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle overuse or strain, injury, or underlying conditions such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.073, 0.249, 0.603] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the term "pop music" originated in the 1950s and 1960s, as a catch-all term for popular music that was not classified under other genres such as rock, jazz, or country. The term was used to describe music that was in line with the tastes of the urban middle class, and was characterized as "instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers" in contrast to "album-based music for adults."

The term "pop song" was first recorded in 1926, and referred to a piece of music that had popular appeal. Over time, the term "pop music" has evolved to encompass a wide range of styles and genres, including rock, pop-rock, pop-punk, and electronic dance music.

So, to answer your question, the term "pop music" comes from the combination of the words "popular" and "music," and was originally used in the mid-20th century to describe music that was popular among the general public, particularly among teenagers.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.125, 0.228, 0.615] Agent refined response: Yes, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is mentioned in the United States Declaration of Independence, which is a document adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The Declaration states that these rights are unalienable, meaning they cannot be taken away or given up, and that they are among the fundamental rights that all human beings are entitled to.



However, the Declaration of Independence is not a part of the United States Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land in the United States. The Constitution does not explicitly mention the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness," but it does contain provisions that protect individual rights and freedoms, such as the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and religion, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law.





In summary, while the phrase "life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness" is not in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, which predates the Constitution, sets forth these fundamental rights as the basis for the United States government and its relationship with its citizens.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.000, 0.181, 0.539] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided earlier, the hormones of the anteriorpituitary gland are created through the following process:

1. Stress induces the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from the hypthalamus.
2. CRH and vasopressin activate the release of adrenocorticoctic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitarygland.

3. ACTH acts on the adrenal cortexto produce glucocorticoids, such as cortisol.

4. These glucocorticoids actback on the anterior pituitarygand and the hypothalamus withnegative feedback to slow the production of CRH.

Therefore, the hormones of the anteriortypuital gland are created through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is a complex neuroendocrine system that involves the interaction of multiple hormones and organs.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.000, 0.174, 0.606] Agent refined response: Based on the knowledge provided, secretory cells of endocrine Glands secrete their products through the following mechanisms:

1. Serous cells secrete proteins, including enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells.
2. Mucous cells secrete mucin. Examples include Brunner's glands, esaphageal glands, and plyoric glands.
3. Mixed glands secrete both proteins and mucus. Examples include the salivary glands, although the parotid gland is predominantly serous.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.026, 0.169, 0.581] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss due to a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. It is caused by the presence of the androgen receptor gene, which is inherited from one's parents. As men age, the levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in their bodies increase, leading to hair loss. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in the hair follicles. Over time, the hair follicles are shrunk, leading to a gradual reduction in hair growth and eventual baldness.

Other factors that can contribute to male pattern baldness include:

* Genetics: A family history of male pattern baldness increases the risk of developing the condition.
* Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormone levels, such as an excess of DHT, can contribute to hair loss.

* Stress: Prolonged periods of stress can lead to an increase in the production of cortisol, a hormone that can contribute to hair loss.
* Poor diet: A diet lacking in essential nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and biotin, can contribute to hair loss.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.000, 0.237, 0.578] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, cones are located in the following areas of the eye:

* The fovea: Cones are greatly outnumbered by rods in most parts of the Retina, but they are much more numerous in the fovea.
* The fovea is a small, specialized area in the center of the retina that is responsible for high-acuity vision.

So, the cones in the eye are primarily located in the fovea.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.130, 0.258, 0.644] Agent refined response: Connective tissue is found throughout the body, including in the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the meninges, which are the three outer membranes that envelop the brain and spine, are composed of connective tissue and provide support and protection to the brain and spinal cord. Connective tissue is also found in other parts of the body, such as:

* Blood vessels: Connective tissue surrounds and supports blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries.
* Lymphatic system: Connective tissue forms the walls of lymph vessels and lymph nodes, and supports the immune system.
* Muscles: Connective tissue attaches muscles to bones and other structures, and provides support and stability to the musculoskeletal system.
* Bones: Connective tissue forms the bone matrix, which provides structural support and protection to the bone.
* Tendons and ligaments: Connective tissue connects muscles to bones and other tissues, and provides support and stability to joints.
* Aponeuroses: Connective tissue forms the membranes that support and separate muscles, and provide a framework for the musculoskeletal structure.
* Cornea: Connective tissue forms the cornea, the clear outer layer of the eye.
* Organs: Connective tissue supports and connects organs in the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and spleen.

In summary, connective tissue is found throughout the human body, and plays a crucial role in supporting and connecting various structures and organs, as well as providing protection and support to the nervous system.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.
[0.000, 0.183, 0.529] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the religion in the Virginia Colony during the 18th century was primarily Anglican, also known as Episcopalian. However, after the American Revolution, many Anglican clergy and loyalists went into exile, and the local vestry no longer distributed funds or had local government functions such as providing poor relief.

In 1790, the Right Reverend James Madison, a cousin of Patriot James Madison, was appointed as the first Episcopal Bishop of Virginia, and he slowly rebuilt the denomiation within the framework of freedom of choice of belief and worship (see also Virginia Portal and History of Religion in the United States).

The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck.

It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.000, 0.165, 0.497] Agent refined response: In addition to also appearing in several other contexts, the number also appears in textbooks to signify "three" but not, as in the United States, in conjunction with "thousand"; this is because three is the first digit to appear more than once in a number in the English language. This is a more recent development in the 20th century; in the 19th century, the third digit (3) was not a number to be used in place of a thousand. This is why in 1950s England there is a famous comic strip called The Three Musketeers. In the United States, the number three is not used in this way.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.000, 0.211, 0.551] Agent refined response: That was a great start. The Islamic religion was founded by a single person. This person was Muhammad, also known as the Prophet Muhammad. The Quran and Hadith were also created by him. The Quran was the first of the Islamic scriptures to be revealed to him. The Hadith was compiled over a period of 200 years after his death. The Sunnah, the way of life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, forms the basis of the Shia and Sunni schools of Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is also the founder of the Ummah (the global Islamic community), the leader of the Muslim Ummah, and the founder of the city of Medina.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.000, 0.131, 0.538] Agent refined response: As an infinite series may be defined as a limit of a function, an infinite series may not converge. As such, the limit of a function (e.g. a function (x → 0) → 0) does not exist, if the function does not converge. A function may not converge if it has a divergent infinite series (e.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯ (infinite)) as a Taylor series. It may also not converge if the function does not have a Taylor series (e.g. the Cantor function). A function may also not have a limit if it has a discontinuity (e.g. the function (x → 0) has a discontinuity at x = 0).

Prompt: what does the sun represent on the uruguay flag
Ground truth: The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay, based on the U.S flag, where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance. The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santillán, the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti, the sun god of the Inca religion. It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia.
[0.063, 0.288, 0.615] Agent refined response: According to the flag of Uruguay; the sun from the center of the flag represents the national motto of Uruguay; May the sun of independence never set over the homeland.

Prompt: when did beryl markham fly across the atlantic
Ground truth: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.
[0.061, 0.234, 0.608] Agent refined response: Because of her early death, Markham never achieved her ambition of flying solo across the Atlantic. She made a non-stop east-west flight from Darwin to Karachi, on a 1936 Percival Vega, and made a non-stop flight from Nairobi to Cairo on a 1939 de Havilland Gypsy Moth (the first woman to make the journey). Markham also made the first solo transcontinental flight from east to west across Africa. She also set the first woman-only record for solo flight across the Atlantic from east to west. Markham was the first woman to be granted the Alamein Flying Cup.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.061, 0.296, 0.633] Agent refined response: A round roast is a cut of beef from the hindquarters, "eye" of the round is the section of the animal from the "eye" muscle (the muscle in the head), including the eye itself, and is a lean cut of meat. When cooked, it is tender and flavorful with a roast-like texture. Eye of round is a lesser-quality cut of beef and is often discarded. It is sometimes ground or used in stews or slow cooking. When roasted, it is more tender and flavorful than ground beef. It is not a popular cut of meat and is often less expensive.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.000, 0.214, 0.620] Agent refined response: Bullets usually fall back to the ground unless they are spinning at the right angle to be captured by the Earth rotation so that they can be fired again. When fired at a high velocity, the bullet can penetrate the atmosphere, it will lose its forward motion, and its trajectory will be affected by the air resistance it encounters. As the bullet is heavier than air it will be subject to a downward motion and the air resistance will cause it to spin and lose its forward motion. It is impossible to predict the exact path of a bullet fired in the air as its trajectory is influenced by many factors and varies greatly depending upon the projectile and the environment.

Prompt: where does the saying keeping up with the jones come from
Ground truth: The phrase originates with the comic strip Keeping Up with the Joneses, created by Arthur R. "Pop" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in The New York World and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title.

The phrase "keeping up with the Joneses" originally referred to the anxiety of those in the lower classes who wanted to emulate the perceived higher status of the Joneses. The phrase evolved into the modern idiom "keeping up with the Jones" in the mid-20th century.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.000, 0.198, 0.566] Agent refined response: Pop has its roots in various forms of popular music, but has sometimes been used as a catch-all term for popular music, sometimes implying a lack of seriousness or artistic depth. The term has often been associated with "light" (rather than "serious") music, and has sometimes been used as a synonym for "popular music". In the 1950s, some musicologists described the style as "light" music, contrasting it with what they described as "serious" or "art" music, while others described the style as "popular music", contrasting it with what they described, in the 1970s, as "rock music".

Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.122, 0.278, 0.606] Agent refined response: Yes, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, is a phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence, and is a common law right, not a constitutional right. The phrase "life, liberty and the pursuit of happyness" is a reference to the idea of "property in one's self". This phrase is the central idea in the concept of individual rights, and is mentioned in the United States Declaration of Sentiments, which is the source of the phrase. The phrase is used in the United States Declaration of independence to describe the rights which are "self-evident" and "unalienable".

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.047, 0.250, 0.582] Agent refined response: Humans, with the exception of the pineal gland, have a monophasic anterior pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary gland secretes hormones from the hypothalamus (hypophysis), with the hypothalamus containing the neurohypophysis (vasopressin and oxytocin), the pars intermedia (prolactin) and the pars anterior (TSH, FSH, LH and ACTH). These hormones have a variety of functions, including regulation of metabolism, reproductive cycle, growth and development, and the immune system. The hypothalamus has two main parts, the ventromedial nucleus (VMN) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which produce the hormones of the anterior lobe (TSH, FSH, and LH) which regulate the thyroid, gonads and adrenal glands.

Ground truth: The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution.

This principle was enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison and by it the Court established a broad implication of the doctrine of States rights, as well as a limitation of the power of the federal government. This doctrine had been anticipated by the U.S. Constitution itself, by its provisions for a system of federal government, as well as by its republican character.

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.057, 0.204, 0.620] Agent refined response: In 1773 the British Parliament passed the Tea Act because it gave the British East India Company a monopoly on all tea in the American colonies, which was not only a tax but also a trade restriction, and did not allow other importers to sell tea in the colonies. The colonists, who had previously been accustomed to buying tea smuggled in from other ports, were resistant to paying taxes to the British government, and saw the Tea Act as yet another example of taxation without representation.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.
[0.096, 0.245, 0.601] Agent refined response: No later than March 15 would be the time to beware of the Ides of March. Julius Caesar, who would be assassinated on that day, said "Et tu, Brute?", to Brutus, the man who struck him down, as he was on his way to the Senate, where he was killed by a group of senators who had planned the assassination. This phrase has become a famous historical quote, and the day is widely known as "March 15". This is the origin of the phrase "Beware of the Ides of March". The phrase is a warning that Caesar had given to Brutus, which he used as a way of saying "be careful of what you wish for".

The tallest building in Las Vegas is The Drew Las Vegas, which rises 735 feet (224 m) and was topped out in November 2008. This building, however, is currently on hold. The tallest completed building in the city is the 52-story Palazzo, which rises 642 feet (196 m) and was completed in 2007.
[0.097, 0.266, 0.642] Agent refined response: The Strat was topped out on November 18, 2000, and is currently 1,149 feet (350 m) tall. However, the height of the Strat was increased to 1,150 feet (350 m) in 2002, making it the tallest building in Las Vegas. The Strat was the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere until the completion of One World Trade Center in New York City in November 2014. The Strat was designed by architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) and was the tallest building in the world when the project was announced in 1998.

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.
[0.000, 0.219, 0.579] Agent refined response: and the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Columbus sailed the Caribbean and the Golf of Mexico in 1492 and 1493, and on his third voyage, in 1498, he explored the waters of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola. In 1493, he named the Bahamas for the pink shells called conch shells that were abundant on the islands. The first landfall of Columbus in the New World was on the north coast of Haiti, on the island of Hispaniola.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.000, 0.118, 0.496] Agent refined response: Both maternal and paternal genetics are important. Although hair loss can be inherited, it is not a guarantee that someone will lose their hair if they have a family history of baldness. (See also androgenetic alopecia.) Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a genetic disorder in which the body produces androgens (male hormones) that cause hair follicles to shrink and stop producing hair. This condition has been associated with X-linked inheritance and autosomal dominant inheritance. In X-linked inheritance, the gene is located on the X chromosome and has been identified as AR (androgen receptor) and also has been linked to mutations in the androgen receptor gene. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been linked to mutations in androgen receptor gene, X chromosome and androgen receptor gene.

Prompt: who represents the insured in the investigation of a claim
Ground truth: Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.
[0.067, 0.229, 0.591] Agent refined response: adjuster or investigator hired by the insurer, after the policyholder has filed a claim. The investigator will gather information and evidence to support the claim and determine the extent of the loss or damage. The insurer may send an adjuster to the scene of the loss or accident, which is the location of the loss or damage, to assess the extent of the damage and to determine the cost of repairs or replacement. If the loss or damage occurred in a vehicle, the adjuster may inspect the vehicle and review any relevant documentation, such as the police report, to determine the extent of the damage.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.
[0.000, 0.178, 0.539] Agent refined response: Common weapons and armor were often ornamented with a hilt or scabbard. The scabbard was often decorated with skulls and crossbones. A 16th-century work (1560) depicts the Grim Reaper carrying a scythe with a plain wooden handle. In 17th-century prints, the Grim Reaper is often depicted carrying a scythe with a curved blade and a decorated handle. The scythe was a symbol of death and rebirth in ancient Egypt. It was the most common weapon of the Grim Reaper. A scythe with a curved handle was the weapon of choice of the Grim Reaper in ancient Egypt.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.000, 0.178, 0.561] Agent refined response: The timing of diebacks can vary. The causes may be immediate or delayed. A dieback may occur in a single year or over several years. A dieback is usually only noticeable after its onset and is not always predictable. There are several factors that can cause a dieback, such as extreme weather events or the lack of water. The rate of dieback is determined by the severity of the drought and the individual plant's ability to survive. A dieback can occur in any plant and can be caused by a variety of factors. The plant's ability to survive is affected by its genetic makeup and its environment.

Prompt: what's the difference between salisbury steak and hamburger steak
Ground truth: Salisbury steak is a dish made from a blend of ground beef and other ingredients and is usually served with gravy or brown sauce. Hamburg steak is a similar product but differs in ingredients.
[0.000, 0.165, 0.509] Agent refined response: Only 1 / 3 of steaks are formed into patties, and the size and thickness of the patty may vary, but the salisbury steak is thicker than the hamburger steak. A steak patty is usually 1 / 4 inch thick, and the size of the patty is not a factor in the cooking time. The thickness of the patty is important in the cooking time, and a thicker patty (which is more than 1 / 4 inch) will take longer to cook. A salisbury steak is thinner than a hamburger steak, and is often cut into a thickness of 1 / 4 inch.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.138, 0.337, 0.609] Agent refined response: The meninges are the protective membranes of the central nervous system (CNS). The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges. The meninges are composed of the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The dura mater is the outermost meningeal layer (also called the tough, fibrous meningeal layer). The arachnoid mater is the middle meningeal layer (also called arachnoid membrane). The pia mater is the innermost meningeal layer (also called pial membrane). The pia mater is also called the pial membrane. The pia mater is a thin, delicate membrane of the brain, adhering closely to the surface of the brain. The arachnoid mater is a thin, vascular membrane of the brain.

Prompt: when did the nba add the three point line
Ground truth: In the 1979--80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.
[0.000, 0.190, 0.532] Agent refined response: 1. Three-point line (American basketball) Three-point line (also three-point arc) was first used in the 1954 (American) National Basketball League (NBL) game between the Fort Wayne Pipers and the Rochester Royals as a way to create a faster game. The three-point line was introduced as a means to make the game more exciting, as the score was becoming too lopsided. The line was not in the rulebook, but was drawn by the scorer in the middle of the court. The Pipers won the game 92--82, but the three-point line was not used again until 1967.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.000, 0.197, 0.598] Agent refined response: Cones, like most other photoreceptors, are concentrated in the central retina, where visual acuity is highest, but are fewer in the periphery. The distribution of cones varies by species, with the highest density in the fovea, where the cones are arranged in a mosaic. They are most numerous at the center of the retina, where they are densely packed. They are typically found at the back of the eye, opposite the lens. The cones are most numerous at the center of vision and are arranged in a mosaic pattern. The central 10 degrees of the visual field is where most of the cones are located.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.127, 0.337, 0.665] Agent refined response: Including the nervous system, connective tissue can be found in the body. In the nervous system, connective cells are the main component of the meninges and the myelin sheath. The meninges are membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. They are composed of connective tissue and include the dura mater (the outermost membrane), the arachnoid mater (the middle membrane), and the pia mater (the innermost membrane). The meninges contain nerve fibers and produce cerebrospinal fluid. They include blood vessels and nerve fibers. The meninges help protect the brain and spinal cord and facilitate their growth.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.048, 0.237, 0.587] Agent refined response: Before birth (gestation), the heart initially forms from two tube -like structures, called the first and second heart tubes. This begins at approximately 2 weeks (14 days) of gestation with a fusion of the first and second heart tubes forming the primitive heart tube. The first heart tube forms from the forerunbs and the second from the hindbrain. The first heart tube forms the left ventricle and left atrium, and the second forms the right ventricle and right atrium. The right ventricle and right atria are derived from the third and fourth arches, and the left ventricle and left auricle, from the fourth and fifth arches.

Prompt: where does decussation occur in the spinothalamic pathway
Ground truth: The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.
[0.103, 0.343, 0.699] Agent refined response: Spinal cord neurons send axons to the contralateral (opposite) side of the body via the decussation of the posterior white commissure, the anterior white commissure and the anterior commissure of the medulla oblongata (the latter via the cranial nerves). Thus, the decussation of the posterior commissure results in the cross-over of the ascending spinothalamic tracts, while the decussation of the anterior commissure results in the cross over of the descending spinothalamic tract. Decussation typically occurs in the ventral white matter of the spinal cord. Decussation is the only area of cross-over in the spinal cord.

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison. The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution, which replaced hanging. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling declaring existing capital punishment statutes unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972), New York was without a death penalty until 1995, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a new statute into law, which provided for execution by lethal injection.
[0.000, 0.262, 0.648] Agent refined response: The state of New York abolished the death penalty, as a means of punishment, in 1977. The first New York execution by electrocution took place in 1890, and the last occurred in 1977. To further emphasize the state of New York as being "death penalty-free", a moratorium on executions was imposed in 1972, leading to the eventual abolition of the death penalty. In 1977, New York State enacted a new law, repealing the death penalty. As of 2007, the New York State Legislature has not re-enacted the death penalty.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.

The church was also responsible for administering the oath of allegiance and enforcing the oath of abjuration of the English monarch (in 1677). In 1619, the Church of England had been established in the colony and had authority over the religious affairs of the colony (and the colonists).

Prompt: when was the biltmore house opened to the public
Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism. Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.

In 1942, the estate was taken over by the United States government to serve as a temporary military hospital during World War II.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.000, 0.176, 0.519] Agent refined response: That was a huge success. There was a debate as to whether the Quran was the word of God or the word of Muhammad. This was also the beginning of the Islamic Golden Age. The Arabian Peninsula had been a crossroads of trade and religion since the ancient period. The Islamic conquests of the Sassanid Empire and the Byzantine Empire (also known as the Eastern Roman Empire) continued under the Rashidun Caliphate (632--661 CE), with the Islamic conquest of Persia (633--651 CE) and the Islamic conquest of Syria (634--669 CE) being considered the most significant. The conquests were also marked by the Islamic conquest of Egypt (641 CE) and the Islamic invasion of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey).

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words").

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.067, 0.168, 0.578] Agent refined response: As regards as an infinite series, a limit may not exist if the series does not converge, i.e. the series goes on indefinitely (i.e., an infinite number of terms). An example of a function that does not have a limit is f (x) =  1 / (1 + x), as the function can be made as large as one likes by taking x large enough (i.e., the function can be made as large (in absolute value) as one likes). The limit of the function as x approaches infinity is 0, but it does not exist. It is also possible to have a function (e.g. f (x) = x) where the limit of the function does not exist at a single point (i.e. the function does not have a limit at any point).

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

This cut is also known as a "butler steak" or "rump steak" in some countries, and is leaner than the more tender and flavorful "eye of the loin" cut.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.000, 0.172, 0.606] Agent refined response: Bullets usually lose most of their velocity when fired at sea level because the air resistance they encounter can only push them downward with a force equal to their weight. If the bullet is fired at a steep angle, it will penetrate the atmosphere at a higher velocity, before it begins to lose its velocity, so the bullet can travel long distances in the atmosphere and its trajectory is influenced by the air resistance and the angle of its trajectory. The bullet can be damaged by the friction with the air and its trajectory is influenced by its mass and shape. Bullets are designed to be aerodynamic and are made of materials that can withstand the heat generated by the friction with the air.

Prompt: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany
Ground truth: Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould. Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

Prompt: when did the right to buy scheme start
Ground truth: After Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979, the legislation to implement the Right to Buy was passed in the Housing Act 1980. Michael Heseltine, in his role as Secretary of State for the Environment, was in charge of implementing the legislation. Some 6,000,000 people were affected; about one in three actually purchased their housing unit. Heseltine noted that "no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people". He said the right to buy had two main objectives: to give people what they wanted, and to reverse the trend of ever-increasing dominance of the state over the life of the individual.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.053, 0.230, 0.589] Agent refined response: Trigger points or painful spots. also known as "tender points" or "Trigger points", are areas of taut muscle tissue that also contain a "spindle" of muscle fibers. These spindles are also known as "myofascial trigger points" and can cause pain, stiffness, numbness, or weakness in muscles and connective tissue. Other trigger points may be located along nerves or their branches (peripheral nerves) or within the spinal cord and brain (central nervous system). Trigger points can cause pain that radiates to other areas of the body and may be associated with muscle spasms and limited range of motion.

Ground truth: Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province. It was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in 1867. Isma'il Pasha and Tewfik Pasha governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty until the British occupation of 1882. Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867--1914) remained a de jure Ottoman province until 5 November 1914, when it was declared a British protectorate in reaction to the decision of the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.040, 0.218, 0.563] Agent refined response: Pop has its roots in a number of different styles of music, including early forms of rock and roll, doo-wop, and Motown, and sometimes includes catchy hooks and/or riffs. Some of the most popular pop music today (often termed "pop-rock") has roots in the rock and roll of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Some have argued that the term "pop" has come to refer to a more general trend of popular music, rather than a particular genre, with some genres such as hip-hop and electronic dance music having become the most popular forms of music in the 21st century.

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".

The United States Declaration of Independence is a statement of political philosophy which describes the rights and principles that the Thirteen Colonies in North America stated to be the reason for seeking independence from Great Britain. The Declaration has had a profound impact upon political philosophy, and is a key document in the history of democracy.

Prompt: when did equus first appear in fossil record
Ground truth: The first Old World equid fossil was found in the gypsum quarries in Montmartre, Paris, in the 1820s. The tooth was sent to the Paris Conservatory, where it was identified by Georges Cuvier, who identified it as a browsing equine related to the tapir. His sketch of the entire animal matched later skeletons found at the site.
[0.000, 0.177, 0.494] Agent refined response: Equus, having its origin around 45 million years ago, was not yet present in the fossil record. It was therefore not until  around 30 million years ago, during the late Miocene, that the first Equus fossils were found. The first known Equus, a species known as Equus quagga, was found in Africa (the name is derived from the Zulu word for zebra). Equus was once thought to be a distinct genus; however, it is now considered to be a subgenus of the genus Equus (E. quagga is now the earliest known member of the Equus genus). All Equus species are now extinct. Equus simus (the zebra) and Equus caballus (the wild ass) are both thought to have originated around 2.5 million years ago.

Prompt: sending money home to the native country is an example of
Ground truth: A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker to an individual in his or her home country. Money sent home by migrants competes with international aid as one of the largest financial inflows to developing countries. Workers' remittances are a significant part of international capital flows, especially with regard to labour-exporting countries. In 2014, $436 billion went to developing countries, setting a new record. Overall global remittances totaled $582 billion in 2015. Some countries, such as India and China, receive tens of billions of US dollars in remittances each year from their expatriates and diaspora.

Remittances are in contrast to international aid, such as foreign aid from governments and other organizations. Remittances from diaspora communities are one of the largest contributors to foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries. In 21 countries, remittances from diaspora exceeded the total amount of foreign direct investment in 2013. Remittances are widely used as a means of transferring funds from migrant workers to their families.

Prompt: who was charlie writing to in perks of being a wallflower movie
Ground truth: The story begins with a quiet, sensitive 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters about his life to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that person because he said that he heard the person was nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.
[0.000, 0.135, 0.477] Agent refined response: That which they say in the book (which I heard) is that it was meant to be a letter. It was meant to be read by "Friend" which Charlie never specified. This was a recurring theme throughout the book: the inability to communicate (and, therefore, to express himself). He was going to write it ("The letter") on a "piece of paper", as he states in the book, "and put it in a corner for someone to find." For Charlie, the letter itself has a special significance because it has the potential to change the way he feels about himself. Charlie's writing style is a major aspect of the book, and he often uses the imagery of letters to explore his feelings.

Ground truth: Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.
[0.039, 0.166, 0.509] Agent refined response: As a whooping cough vaccine that was effective against pertussis became widely available in the 1940s, but the vaccine did not completely eliminate the disease. Before the introduction of the pertussis vaccine in the 1940 s there were some attempts at vaccine development. In the early 20th century researchers used various animal-derived pertussis vaccines but these were not effective against human pertussis. In the 1930s scientists were able to isolate the pertussis toxin from Bordetella pertussis and began developing a vaccine that used the toxin to stimulate an immune response. An early vaccine developed by Dr. Albert Sabin was tested in the 1940.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.000, 0.182, 0.564] Agent refined response: Developing, maintaining pituitary function is critical for overall body homeostasis. The anterior pituitary gland is responsible for secreting hormones in response to hypothalamic signals. This hormone secretion regulates a wide range of bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. The anterior pituitary secretes these hormones in response to the hypothalamus's signals. The hypothalamus acts as a regulator of hormone secretion by secreting hormones (such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormine) which in turn stimulate the anterior pituitary to release the appropriate hormones. The anterior pituitary has a high concentration of cells with a specific pattern of gene expression. The gene expression pattern of these cells is established during development and is maintained through cellular differentiation.

Prompt: to whom do the powers not given to the federal government by the constitution go
Ground truth: The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people.
[0.000, 0.254, 0.602] Agent refined response: By the U.S. Constitution it is the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Constitution was divided into three branches of government: the legislative, executive and judicial. The Constitution provides that each branch of government was to be separate and independent of the others. This was intended to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful. It was to provide a check and balance upon the power of the others. It also defined the powers and duties of each branch. The powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution (Article I, Section 8) are the powers of the states and the people. This also applies to the powers not delegated to the states by the Constitution. It also applies to the powers not prohibited to the people by the Constitution.

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: who came up with the first working periodic table
Ground truth: The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties. The most important event in its history occurred in 1869, when the table was published by Dmitri Mendeleev, who built upon earlier discoveries by scientists such as Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier and John Newlands, but who is nevertheless generally given sole credit for its development.
[0.038, 0.199, 0.571] Agent refined response: The limitations of the early table proved a significant problem in the field of chemistry. A number of attempts were made to create a table which better reflected the chemical elements known at the time, but none of these were successful. In 1863, its most influential chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev, who had been trying to organize all known chemical elements into a coherent table for over a decade, finally succeeded. Mendeleev was assisted by his brother Ivan who helped him compile his table. His work laid foundation for modern chemistry. Mendeleev published his table in 1869. However his table was not complete until 1871 when he included all 66 known elements. His table contained all known elements until 1919.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.069, 0.217, 0.617] Agent refined response: In 1773 the British Parliament passed the Tea Act because it wanted to help its "loaned" colonies in America pay their debts to British merchants, and it wanted to ensure that the colonies would not be able to trade freely with other countries. The British government had long held the right to tax the colonies, but it had not previously taxed the tea they imported. The Tea Act, however, imposed a tax on all tea consumed in the colonies, and it allowed the only authorized importer of tea to be the British East India Company, which was a monopoly and had been the main importer of tea to the colonies.

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).
[0.000, 0.196, 0.593] Agent refined response: The construction of the pyramid by the pharaoh Khufu also led to a series of architectural innovations. Its base,  with a perimeter of about 1,000 meters, is a square of 230 meters side, with a height of  481 meters. The pyramid took approximately 20 years to build, and required the work of 100,000 workers, mostly skilled craftsmen, engineers, and laborers. The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for the pharaoh Khufu, was the largest of the pyramids. It contains an estimated 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.000, 0.166, 0.640] Agent refined response: Secretory cells--endocrine cells--secrete their products into bloodstreams, rather than urine. The products of endocrine cells are chemical messengers that help regulate various physiological processes. The secretory cells secrete their products into the bloodstreams that are close to the endocrine glands. The hormones secreted by the endocrine cells pass through the bloodstreams to the target cells, where they bind to the receptors. The hormones include thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine), insulin, growth hormone, oxytocin, prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The endocrine cells include thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, adrenal gland, pancreas, pituitary gland, and ovary.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.
[0.064, 0.235, 0.598] Agent refined response: Brutus would later use this phrase to Caesar before he stabbed him. This would later be referenced in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, which ends with the famous line "Et tu, Brute?", meaning "And you, Brutus?", to show that Brutus had betrayed Caesar. As the ides of March is the day of Caesar's assassination, this phrase is often used to reference the idea of "betrayal" or "murder". This phrase is not a direct quote, but is a reference to the original "Beware the Ides of March", which is a famous phrase in history. This phrase was not said by Caesar; the actual line is "Beware the Ides Of March".

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.
[0.000, 0.230, 0.569] Agent refined response: and Columbus and his crew and the Spanish and Portuguese explorers and colonizers. The Spanish and Portuguese first explored the waters and lands of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola, and by 1493, the Spanish had established settlements on the island of Hispaniola, and by the 1520s, the Spanish had established an empire in the Caribbean. The Spanish later explored the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Strait of Florida. This was later confirmed by Ponce de Leon's voyage to Florida in 1513.

Prompt: who represents the insured in the investigation of a claim
Ground truth: Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.
[0.000, 0.176, 0.566] Agent refined response: After reviewing the policy, it should be filed within 30 days of the occurrence or after the policyholder has suffered a loss. The policyholder or the insured (or the insured's representative) should be present at the investigation, which is conducted by the insurance company. Insurers may not investigate claims themselves, and they may use the services of a public insurance adjuster, who is an independent contractor hired by the insurer to represent the insured's interests in the claims process. If the insurer does not use a public adjuster, the insured may not have the opportunity to select an adjuster of their choice, which may be an advocate for the insured.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.
[0.000, 0.170, 0.545] Agent refined response: Common people and religious figures often depicted the Grim Reaper or Death with a scythe or a sickle. The sickle was a popular agricultural tool in the Middle Ages (12th--15th centuries). It was often carried by peasants and farmers. The scythe, however, was a more specialized tool that cuts crops with a curved blade. According to folklore, the Grim Reaper's scythe was made of black iron, forged from the swords of fallen knights. The blade was so sharp that it could cut through armor and metal. The scythe's handle was often made of wood, bone, or ivory.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.000, 0.160, 0.525] Agent refined response: Both parents. It is one of the most common inherited conditions. Although it has been thought, in the past, that this condition is more common in men than women, there are many women who have a similar condition. In these cases, hair loss may be similar to that seen in men with male pattern baldness (alopecia areata). In these cases, hair loss is usually patchy and limited to one area of the scalp. In women, hair loss may be patchy and limited to one area (alopecia areata) or more widespread and similar to male pattern baldness (female pattern baldness). The condition has been linked to a number of genes and genetic variations, including androgen receptor gene (AR), hormone receptor gene (HR), hormone-sensitive gene (H) and HLH (Hair Loss Hormone). Hair loss in women is also associated with certain hormonal imbalances, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Prompt: what's the difference between salisbury steak and hamburger steak
Ground truth: Salisbury steak is a dish made from a blend of ground beef and other ingredients and is usually served with gravy or brown sauce. Hamburg steak is a similar product but differs in ingredients.
[0.000, 0.229, 0.602] Agent refined response: Only a few inches, but very large in taste and texture, and the quality of the meat can vary greatly between the two. Salisbury steak is more common in canned or frozen forms, and is made with leaner cuts of meat. The meat is ground, and then formed into a patty. The "sausage" is not cooked in a casing, and is often served with a gravy. The quality of the meat is not necessarily higher than that of hamburger steak, and the meat is often not as well-formed. The resulting product is more like a meatloaf.
================================================================================
Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.000, 0.209, 0.581] Agent refined response: Dieback means the process of the decline. In some cases, a species ' population may be reduced by a significant amount, or even extirpated. The mechanism is thought to be a result of environmental stress and genetic drift. A population crash can occur when the number of individuals in a population declines rapidly and often to the point of extinction. The reasons are usually natural and can be due to the species ' ability to adapt to its environment and the result of competition and predation. The decline can be caused by factors such as habitat destruction or fragmentation and overhunting. A population crash can occur in a single generation or may be a result of a long-term decline.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.148, 0.284, 0.572] Agent refined response: The three layers of the meninges are the dura mater (outermost), arachnoid mater (middle) and pia mater (innermost). The dura mater is a tough, leathery membrane of collagen and elastin. The arachnoid mater is a thin, vascular membrane of collagen and elastic fibers. The pia mater is a delicate, vascular membrane of the brain and spinal cord. The meninges are responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord, and are involved in the exchange of nutrients and waste products. In the case of meningitis, the meninges become inflamed, which can cause fever, headache, and the sensitivity to light.

Prompt: when did the nba add the three point line
Ground truth: In the 1979--80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.
[0.071, 0.224, 0.559] Agent refined response: 1. Three-point line (also three-point shot) 3 (American basketball) three-point line (also three- point shot) 3.1 (British basketball) was a line at a maximum of 23 feet 9 inches from the basket and was introduced in the 1979--80 season as a way to encourage more scoring from outside the three-point line. It was not a rule until the 1980--81 season, when it was made a part of the NBA Official Rules. The line was 25 feet (7.62 m) from the basket in the 1977--78 season.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.000, 0.174, 0.578] Agent refined response: Cones, like most other photoreceptors, are distributed across the retina, but are most numerous in the central part, where the visual acuity is highest. They have a characteristic bipolar shape, with two cell bodies located at the retinal pigment epithelium. Because of their position, cones are able to detect light more efficiently than rods, whereas rods are more sensitive to low light levels. It is believed that the rod cells are able to sense the direction of the light, whereas the cone cells are able to sense the color of the light.

Prompt: where do pineapples come from in the world
Ground truth: Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in five to ten months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest. In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
[0.069, 0.187, 0.557] Agent refined response: Pineapples originate, the Caribbean Islands. The first pineapple fruit is believed to have been cultivated in South America and the Caribbean: Christopher Columbus brought pineapple to Europe and also introduced it to the West Indies and South America in 1493, and it was brought to the Philippines by Spanish conquistadors in 1521. The pineapple was also brought to Hawaii in 1813 by Polynesian people who migrated to the islands. It was also introduced to Africa in the 19th century. Pineapples are now grown in tropical and subtropical countries around the world, such as Costa Rica, Brazil, and China.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.000, 0.130, 0.532] Agent refined response: Some people celebrate April Fools ' Day by sending text messages and emails on or around 1 April. The "holiday" is often celebrated in other countries on or around 1 April. In some countries their celebrations are very similar to those in the UK. In others (e.g., the United States), the day is not widely observed. The celebrations are usually short, usually lasting only a few minutes, although some people might be fooled for longer periods. The idea is to try to fool people, usually by telling them something which is untrue.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.000, 0.213, 0.612] Agent refined response: In the human body, connective tissue includes the largest tissue group. The main function of connective tissue is to support the body. Connective tissue includes the following: (1) Bone and cartilage. Bone tissue is composed of two types of bone: compact bone and spongy bone. Compact bone is dense and hard (it is the outer portion of bones). Spongy bone is porous and spongy. Bone tissue provides mechanical support, stores calcium, and releases it as needed. Cartilage is a more flexible tissue than bone. There are two types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage and elastic cartilage.

Prompt: name of black man in to kill a mockingbird
Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: what is the approximate volume of the brain
Ground truth: Studies on human brain size, largely based on participants of European ancestry, tend to find an average adult brain volume of 1260 cubic centimeters (cm) for men and 1130 cm for women. There is, however, substantial variation between individuals; one study of 46 adults, aged 22--49 years and of mainly European descent, found an average brain volume of 1273.6 cm for men, with a range of 1052.9 to 1498.5 cm, and 1131.1 cm for women, with a range of 974.9 to 1398.1 cm.
[0.000, 0.162, 0.572] Agent refined response: Human brain studies suggest that adult brains tend to have some very consistent average sizes. For example the human brain has been found to be on average : 1295 cubic centimeters in volume, or about 1. 4 liters. This is notably smaller than the 1500 cubic centimeters of the average human skull, with the cerebral cavity of the brain taking up only about 75 % of the available space. This volume, however, can vary greatly between individuals, with some brains being much larger or smaller than average. There is also evidence that brain size is not the only factor, and that the actual volume of brain tissue is also important.

Prompt: the elements in each period have the same number of
Ground truth: A period in the periodic table is one of the horizontal rows, all of those elements have the same number of electron shells. Going across a period, each element has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. Arranged this way, groups of elements in the same column have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the alkali metals lie in the first column (group 1) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. As of 2016 a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed.

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.
[0.000, 0.219, 0.587] Agent refined response: From the Ancient Maya and Aztecs to the arrival of Europeans. Although chocolate had been enjoyed in Central America for centuries, the first historical references to chocolate in the Americas were by the Aztecs.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.049, 0.244, 0.623] Agent refined response: Before birth (and first heartbeat) and development, the heart initially starts with a tube like structure, called the atrioventricular (first) cavity. This first cavity forms at the junction of the two upper chambers (atria) and the two lower chambers (ventricles). The atrioventricular cavity develops from the fusion of two endocardial tubes that are connected to the primordial atria and ventricles. The first heartbeat and contraction of the heart occurs at approximately 4 weeks of gestation, and the heart begins to pump blood and establishes the cardiac loop, which connects the atria and ventricles.

Prompt: where does decussation occur in the spinothalamic pathway
Ground truth: The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.
[0.122, 0.356, 0.652] Agent refined response: Spinal cord neurons send the axons (the part of the neuron cell body that carries the axon) to the opposite side of the body via the dorsal (back) white matter tracts, in order to form the crossed descending tracts of the spinothalamic pathways. The axons of the cell bodies of the neurons in the lateral gray matter of the spinal cord, in contrast, form the uncrossed ascending tracts of the spinothelamic pathway. The decussation of the cord typically occurs around the 10th--14th day of embryonic development. The decussation of the spinal cord refers to the crossing of the ventral (front) white matter tracts of the spinal cord.

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison. The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution, which replaced hanging. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling declaring existing capital punishment statutes unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972), New York was without a death penalty until 1995, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a new statute into law, which provided for execution by lethal injection.
[0.000, 0.265, 0.644] Agent refined response: The state of New York, as the last state to use the electric chair in the United States, discontinued the practice in 2007. In 1972, the state Legislature mandated the use of lethal injection as the primary method of execution. As of 2007, the state had conducted 621 executions by electrocution, more than any other state.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.

Prompt: what do the 3 dots mean in math
Ground truth: In logical argument and mathematical proof, the therefore sign (∴) is generally used before a logical consequence, such as the conclusion of a syllogism. The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read therefore. It is encoded at U + 2234 ∴ therefore (HTML & # 8756; &there4;). For common use in Microsoft Office hold the ALT key and type "8756". While it is not generally used in formal writing, it is used in mathematics and shorthand. It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.000, 0.134, 0.503] Agent refined response: The three dots in mathematics are called "ellipses" or "ellipses of a curve". They are used to represent a line that is tangent to a curve at a particular point, and they are used in various mathematical contexts. Here are some common ways the three dots are used in mathematics:

1. Tangent lines: In calculus, the three dots are used to represent a tangent line to a curve at a particular point. The tangent line is the line that just touches the curve at that point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.
2. Differentiation: The three dots are used to represent the derivative of a function at a point. The derivative is a measure of how fast the function changes at a particular point, and it is represented by a line that just touches the function at that point.
3. Limits: The three dots are used in the definition of a limit of a function. The limit of a function is the value that the function approaches as the input gets arbitrarily close to a particular point. The three dots are used to indicate that the function is approaching the limit at a particular point.
4. Integration: The three dots are also used in integration to represent the antiderivative of a function. The antiderivative is a function that can be used to compute the definite integral of a function.
5. Other uses: The three dots are also found in other areas of mathematics, such as geometry, topology, and number theory. They are used to represent various geometric shapes, such as lines, circles, and spheres, and they are used to define various topological spaces and algebraic structures.

In general, the three dots are used in calculus to represent the idea of a limit or a derivative, and they are used in other areas of mathematics to represent various geometric and algebraic structures.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

The term "dog and pony show," as used in the United States, is often associated with the phrase "to put on a dog and pony show," which means to put on a show or entertainment, often in a grandiose or pretentious manner. This phrase is often used to describe a performance or entertainment that is overly elaborate or excessive, and is often used in a negative or derogatory manner.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

He was born in Mecca, which is now in modern-day Saudi Arabia, and received his first revelation at the age of 40. Over the next 23 years, he received revelations through the angel Gabriel that were later compiled into the Qur'an, which is the holy book of Islam. He died in 632 CE at the age of 63, and is buried in Medina.

Prompt: what does it mean to be on parole
Ground truth: Parole is a temporary release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the French parole ("voice, spoken words"). The term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word.
[0.000, 0.087, 0.473] Agent refined response: Parole is a supervised release from prison or jail, following a period of incarceration, to the community under the supervision of a parole board. Parole is a form of rehabilitation and reintegration, which allows the offender to reintegrate into society and to make positive contributions to the community. Parole is granted by a parole board, which consists of a panel of officials who are responsible for overseeing the parolee's reintegration into society.

Parole is intended to help offenders make positive changes in their lives, such as finding employment, maintaining a stable residence, and avoiding further criminal activity. Parolees are required to report regularly to their parole officer, who monitors their activities and ensures that they are complying with the terms of their parole.

Parole is a privilege, not a right, and is granted only to those who have demonstrated a willingness to change their behavior and to make positive contributions to society. Parolees are expected to follow a strict set of rules and regulations, which may include:

* Maintaining a stable residence
* Finding and keeping employment
* Avoiding further criminal activity
* Submitting to random drug testing
* Attending counseling or treatment programs
* Paying restitution to victims
* Attending regular meetings with a parole officer

Parole can be granted to offenders who have been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor, depending on the jurisdiction. In some cases, parole may be granted to offenders who have committed a violent crime, such as murder or assault. In other cases, parole may be granted only to offenders who have committed non-violent crimes, such as drug offenses or property crimes.

Parole can be granted in a variety of ways, including:

* Parole on release from prison: Parole is granted to offenders who are released from prison after serving a portion of their sentence.
* Parole on probation: Parole is granted to offenses who are placed on probation instead of being sent to prison.
* Parole on supervised release: Parole is granted to offences who are released from prison after serving their sentence, but are required to report regularly to a parole officer.

Parole is a complex and controversial issue, with many different opinions on its effectiveness. Some argue that parole can help offenders to reintegrate into society and make positive contributions to the community, while others argue that it can lead to a cycle of recidivism and undermine public safety.

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.
[0.028, 0.127, 0.608] Agent refined response: The Stations of the Cross (or the Way of the Cross or Via Crucis) is a Christian devotional practice in which the participant imitates Jesus Christ's last day on Earth as he journeyed to his crucifixion. The stations are usually arranged in a path in a church or other religious building, and the participant moves from one station to the next, meditating on the event or scene depicted at each station.

The stations were first established in the 14th century by the Franciscan friar and missionary Father of the Crusades, Bernard of Clairvaux, who established the first official stations of the cross in the Holy Land. The practice was introduced to Europe by the Franciscans, and it became popular in many countries.

The stations are based on the accounts of the Passion of Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The stations are numbered from one to fourteen, with the first station representing the Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem and the last station representing the Burial of Jesus.

The stations are usually arranged in the following order:

1. The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem
2. The Cleansing of the Temple
3. The Judgment of Pilate
4. The Crucifixion
5. The Lamentation of Jesus
6. The Burial of Jesus
7. The Marys at the Tomb
8. The Angel of the Lord
9. The Marys at the Tabor
10. The Spear of Longinus
11. The Veronica's Veil
12. The Women of Jerusalem
13. The Thief on the Cross
14. The Resurrection

The stations are meant to be meditated upon, with the participant reflecting on the events of the Passion and Death of Jesus, and praying for the graces that come from his sacrifice. The stations are also used as a means of penance, as the participant is invited to pray for the intentions of the Pope and for the intentions of those who are suffering.

The stations are often depicted in art, with images of the Passion of Jesus, and are often accompanied by prayers and hymns. The stations are also used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, with the celebration of the Stations of the Cross on Good Friday, and with the celebration of the stations in the context of the daily Mass.

The stations are also used in other Christian denominations, such as the Anglican Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The stations are also used in some Protestant denominations, such as the Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church.

The stations have been adapted in various ways, such as the addition of new stations, the use of different titles for the stations, and the use of different prayers and hymns. However, the basic structure of the stations remains the same, with the participant moving from one station to the next, reflecting on the events of the passion and death of Jesus.

The stations have been used by many famous artists, such as Michelangelo, Raphael, and Caravaggio, who have depicted the stations in their artwork. The stations have also been used by many composers, such as Franz Liszt, Antonín Dvořák, and Gabriel Fauré, who have composed music for the stations.

The stations have been the subject of many religious and spiritual works, such as the 19th-century novel The Passion of Jesus Christ by the French author Victor Hugo, and the 20th-century novel The Stations of the Cross by the American author Flannery O'Connor.

The stations have also been used in the liturgy of other religions, such as the Hindu religion, with the use of the Stations of the Cross in the Hindu temple of the Kaliya Mardan in India.

The stations have been adopted by many non-Christian religions, such as the Buddhist religion, with the use of the stations in the Buddhist temple of the Borobudur in Indonesia.

The stations have been criticized by some scholars, who argue that the stations are a form of Catholic propaganda, and that they have been used to justify the persecution of Jews and Muslims. However, the stations have also been defended by many scholars, who argue that they are a legitimate form of devotion, and that they have been used by many people throughout history to deepen their understanding of the Passion and Death of Christ.

[0.000, 0.083, 0.494] Agent refined response: Lake Eyre is a saltwater lake located in the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre Basin, South Australia. It is the world's largest and deepest lake, with a surface area of 11,700 square kilometers (4,500 square miles) and a maximum depth of 15 meters (49 feet). The lake is located in the Great Artesian Basin, a large underground water system that covers much of central Australia.

The water that fills Lake Eyre comes from a combination of surface and groundwater sources. The lake is fed by several rivers, including the Georgina River, the Diamantina River, and the Paradox River, which flow into the lake from the surrounding catchment area. The rivers are fed by rainfall and snowmelt in the surrounding mountains and hills, as well as by underground water flowing from the Great Artesian Basin.

In addition to surface water, Lake Eyre also receives water from the Great Artesian Basis, which is a large underground water system that underlies much of central Australia. The Great Artesian Basin is the largest underground water system in the world, covering an area of more than 1.8 million square kilometers (690,000 square miles). It is estimated that the Great Artesian Basin contains up to 100,000 gigaliters (26.4 gigaliters/year) of water, which is recharged by rainfall in the Great Dividing Range and other mountain ranges.

The water in the Great Artesian Basis is under pressure, which causes it to flow through the basin and eventually to the surface in the form of springs, streams, and lakes. The pressure is caused by the weight of the overlying rock and the downward pressure of the water in the basin. The water in the Great Artesian is also enriched with minerals, including salt, lithium, and potassium, which are dissolved in the water as it flows through the basin.

In summary, the water that fills Lake Eyre is a combination of surface water from the rivers that flow into the lake, as well as underground water from the Great ArtesianBasin. The Great Artesian Basis is a large underground water system, which is recharged by rainwater in the Great Dividing Range.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.041, 0.231, 0.602] Agent refined response: A limit of a function does not exist if the function has a singularity or an infinite value. In other words, if the function grows to infinity or becomes undefined as the input approaches a certain value, the limit does not exist.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.000, 0.240, 0.596] Agent refined response: The "eye of round" is a cut of beef that comes from the rump of the animal, just behind the ribs.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.000, 0.164, 0.583] Agent refined response: Bullets are designed to travel in a straight line until they reach their target. When fired in the air, they do not change direction or "go up" to a different location. They are subject to the same gravity as all other objects and fall to the ground or air.

Prompt: who won the battle of stirling bridge 1297
Ground truth: The Battle of Stirling Bridge was a battle of the First War of Scottish Independence. On 11 September 1297, the forces of Andrew Moray and William Wallace defeated the combined English forces of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Cressingham near Stirling, on the River Forth.
[0.065, 0.194, 0.621] Agent refined response: The Battle of Stirling Bridge was a significant Scottish victory in the First War of Scottish Independence. The battle took place on September 11, 1297, near Stirling, Scotland. The Scottish forces, led by William Wallace, were vastly outnumbered by the English army, but they managed to defeat the English through a series of clever tactics.

The English army, led by John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was estimated to be around 10,000 strong, while the Scottish forces, led by William Wallaces, were around 5,000 strong. The English army was well-equipped and well-trained, while the Scottish forces were largely made up of peasants and farmers, with little military experience.

Despite the odds, the Scottish forces were able to use their knowledge of the terrain to their advantage. They had chosen a location where the English army would have to cross a narrow bridge over the River Forth, which was flanked by a deep ravine on both sides. The Scottish forces also had a secret weapon - a series of large, heavy timber beams, which they had hidden in a nearby wood.

As the English army began to cross the bridge, the Scottish forces launched a surprise attack, using the timber beams to block the bridge and trap the English army. The English army was unable to retreat, and was quickly overwhelmed by the Scottish forces. The English army suffered heavy casualties, with many killed or captured, while the Scottish forces suffered relatively few casualties.

The victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge was significant for the Scots, as it marked the first major defeat of the English army in Scotland. It also boosted the morale of the Scottish forces, and helped to galvanize support for the Scottish independence movement.

Prompt: where is the tablet of the ten commandments
Ground truth: According to the bible, both the first shattered set and the second unbroken set were stored in the Ark of the Covenant (the Aron Habrit in Hebrew).
[0.024, 0.098, 0.543] Agent refined response: The tablet of the Ten Commandments is a central object in the biblical account of the covenant between God and the Israelites. According to the biblical account, God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai, and Moses then wrote them on two stone tablets, which were placed in the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark was kept in the Tabernacle, a portable place of worship that the Israelites used during their journey through the wilderness.

The tablets were broken when the Israelites were attacked by the Amalekites, and Moses made a new set of tablets. The broken tablets are said to be in the possession of the Jewish people, and are considered to be a symbol of the covenant between God, the Jewish people, and the nations of the world.

The tablets are not currently in any one place, as they are believed to be hidden away in a secret location, perhaps in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, where the patriarchs of the Jewish people are buried. Some have suggested that the tablets may be hidden in the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, but this is not widely accepted.

The tablets are considered to be a symbol of God's laws and commandments, and are revered by Jews and Christians as a symbol of the divine revelation of God's will. They are also seen as a symbol of the covenant of God with his people, and as a reminder of the moral and ethical principles that are central to the Jewish and Christian faiths.

Prompt: when did the right to buy scheme start
Ground truth: After Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979, the legislation to implement the Right to Buy was passed in the Housing Act 1980. Michael Heseltine, in his role as Secretary of State for the Environment, was in charge of implementing the legislation. Some 6,000,000 people were affected; about one in three actually purchased their housing unit. Heseltine noted that "no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people". He said the right to buy had two main objectives: to give people what they wanted, and to reverse the trend of ever-increasing dominance of the state over the life of the individual.
[0.000, 0.239, 0.554] Agent refined response: The Right to Buy scheme was introduced in 1980 by the Conservative government of the time, with the Housing (Right to Buy) Act 1980. The scheme was designed to allow public sector tenants to purchase their homes at a discounted price. The scheme was introduced as part of the government's policy to encourage home ownership and to reduce the number of social housing properties in the country.

Prompt: where does the saying keeping up with the jones come from
Ground truth: The phrase originates with the comic strip Keeping Up with the Joneses, created by Arthur R. "Pop" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in The New York World and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were unseen characters throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom keeping up with the Joneses has remained popular long after the strip's end.
[0.059, 0.227, 0.612] Agent refined response: The phrase "keeping up with the Joneses" is a common idiom in English that refers to the act of keeping up with one's neighbors or rivals in terms of wealth, social status, or other aspects of life. The phrase is derived from the American comic strip "Kevin and His World" (1904-1912), created by Rudolph Dirks. The strip was about a young boy named Kevin Keene and his family, who lived in a fictional suburban neighborhood. The family was portrayed as the typical American family of the time, with a house and a garden, and the strip was intended to be a humorous commentary on the middle-class lifestyle. The phrase was first used in the strip in 1907, when a character says, "I can't afford to buy anything new, I'm trying to keep up with the Joneses." The phrase became popular in the 1920s and has since become a common idiom in English, used to describe the desire to keep up with one's neighbors and to be seen as successful and prosperous.

Prompt: when was the last time mount ruapehu erupted
Ground truth: At about 8: 20 p.m. on 25 September 2007, a hydrothermal eruption occurred without warning. William Pike, a 22-year-old primary school teacher, had a leg crushed by a rock during the eruption and a rescue operation was mounted to rescue him from the Dome Shelter near the crater. The rock crashed into the Dome Shelter, landed on the man and was too heavy for his companion to lift off.
[0.000, 0.138, 0.484] Agent refined response: Mount Ruapehu is a volcano located in the Tongariro National Park, New Zealand. It is one of the most active volcanoes in New Zealand, with at least 60 eruptions in the past 200 years.

The last eruption of Mount Ruapehu occurred on 18 February 2007, when a steam explosion occurred in the crater lake of the volcano. The explosion caused a plume of steam and ash to rise to a height of 3000 m (9842 ft) and was visible from a distance of 100 km (62 mi). The explosion was caused by the collapse of the crater lake, which had been filling up with water since the last eruption in 1996.

There have been several other eruptions of Mount Ruapehu in recent years, including a series of small steam explosions in 2005 and 2006. The volcano is closely monitored by the Geological Survey of New Zealand and the New Zealand Department of Conservation, and is considered to be at a high level of alert.

It is important to note that the volcano is still active and there is a risk of future eruptions. Visitors to the area are advised to stay away from the crater and to follow the advice of local authorities.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.023, 0.128, 0.559] Agent refined response: Trigger points are located in the muscles and connective tissue, and are points of tenderness or spasm in the muscle. They are often associated with pain, stiffness, or limited range of motion. There are several types of trigger points, including:

1. Myofascial trigger points: These are located in the muscle belly or in the connective tissue that surrounds the muscle. They are often referred to as "knots" or "areas of tension".
2. Muscle spindle trigger points: These are located in muscles that are innervated by the spindle, a sensory receptor that is responsible for detecting changes in length and tension of the muscle.
3. Periosteal trigger points: These are located on the periosteum, a thin layer of connective tissue that covers the bones of the body.
4. Capsular trigger points: These are located in connective tissue that surrounds a joint, and are often associated with joint pain or stiffness.
5. Intra-articular trigger points: These are located within a joint, and are often associated joint pain or stiffness. They are usually located in the ligaments or tendons.
6. Peripheral trigger points: These are located in peripheral nerves, and are often associated with numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected area.
7. Visceral trigger points: These are located within the body's organs, and are often associated with visceral pain or dysfunction.

The most common locations of trigger points in the body are:

* Trigger points in the muscles of the neck and shoulder, particularly the trapezius, levator scapulae, and scalene muscles.
* Trigger points in the chest and abdominal muscles, particularly the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and external oblique muscles.
* Trigger point in the back muscles, particularly the erector spinae, latissimus dorsii, and trapezius muscles.
* Trigger spots in the arms and legs, particularly the biceps, triceps, and hamstrings.
* Trigger points in or near the joints, particularly the knees, elbows, and wrists.

It is important to note that trigger points are not the same as acupuncture points, although they are related to the same basic principles of muscle physiology. Trigger points are points of tenderness or pain in muscles, while acupuncture points are specific points used for therapeutic purposes in traditional Chinese medicine.

Prompt: who was the ottoman governor who led egypt in the years following the napoleonic wars
Ground truth: Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province. It was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in 1867. Isma'il Pasha and Tewfik Pasha governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty until the British occupation of 1882. Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867--1914) remained a de jure Ottoman province until 5 November 1914, when it was declared a British protectorate in reaction to the decision of the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.034, 0.174, 0.587] Agent refined response: The term "pop music" originated in the United States in the early 1950s, as a description of popular music in the broadest sense of the term. The term was used to distinguish popular music from folk music, jazz, blues, and classical music, which were also popular at the time. The term "pop" was used to describe the music that was popular with the general public, as opposed to the more esoteric and specialized genres of music.

The term "pop music" was first used in the 1950s by music critics and journalists to describe the popular music of the time, which was characterized by a strong emphasis on melody, rhythm, and memorable hooks. The term was also used to describe the music of the rock and roll era, which was characterized by the use of electric instruments, a strong backbeat, and a focus on the vocal performance of the lead singer.

The term "pop" was also used to describe the music that was played on the radio and on jukeboxes, which were the most widely available sources of popular music at the time. The term "top 40" was also used to describe the most popular songs in the United States, as determined by a weekly survey of the most popular songs on the radio.

The term "popular music" was also used in the 1957s and 1960s to describe the music of the time, which was a catch-all term for all the different styles of popular music, including rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and country music.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the term "pop music" was used to describe the music of the disco era, which was characterized by a focus on danceability and a strong emphasis on the use of electronic instruments. In the 1990s and 2000s, the term "pop" was used to describes the music of the teen pop and boy bands, which were characterized by a focus on vocal harmonies and a strong emphasis on the visual image of the performers.

In the 2010s, the term "popular music" was used to describe the broad range of popular music styles, including pop, rock, hip-hop, electronic, and country music. The term "pop" was also used in the 2010s to describe the music of individual artists, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry, who were characterized by a strong focus on their vocal performance and their visual image.

In summary, the term "pop music" has a long and complex history, and has been used in different ways at different times to describe different styles of popular music.

Prompt: sending money home to the native country is an example of
Ground truth: A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker to an individual in his or her home country. Money sent home by migrants competes with international aid as one of the largest financial inflows to developing countries. Workers' remittances are a significant part of international capital flows, especially with regard to labour-exporting countries. In 2014, $436 billion went to developing countries, setting a new record. Overall global remittances totaled $582 billion in 2015. Some countries, such as India and China, receive tens of billions of US dollars in remittances each year from their expatriates and diaspora. In 2014, India received an estimated $70 billion and China an estimated $64 billion.

Prompt: what is foreign account tax compliance act (fatca)
Ground truth: The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a 2010 United States federal law requiring all non-U.S. (' foreign ') financial institutions (FFIs) to search their records for customers with indicia of ' U.S.-person ' status, such as a U.S. place of birth, and to report the assets and identities of such persons to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. FATCA also requires such persons to self-report their non-U.S. financial assets annually to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on form 8938, which is in addition to the older and further redundant requirement to self-report them annually to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on form 114 (also known as' FBAR '). Like U.S. income tax law, FATCA applies to U.S. residents and also to U.S. citizens and green card holders residing in other countries.
[0.067, 0.234, 0.632] Agent refined response: The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a United States federal law enacted in 2010, which was designed to increase transparency and exchange of information between the United States and other countries. The law was enacted to combat tax evasion by U.S. taxpayers using offshore accounts and to increase the amount of tax revenue collected by the U.S. government.

FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) and other non-U.S. entities to report information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayors, or to report directly to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U .S. taxpayers. FATCA also imposes a 30% withholding tax on certain payments made to non-compliant FFIs.

The law was enacted to require foreign financial institutions to report to the U.S. government information about financial accounts held by U,S. taxpayers, and to withhold a 30% tax on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions. The law also imposes a requirement on non-U.S. financial institutions to report to the U,S. government information about financial accounts of U.S. taxpayers.

FATCA is a complex law, and its implementation has been controversial. Critics argue that it imposes a significant compliance burden on non-U.S. banks and financial institutions, and that it has created confusion and difficulties for non-U.S. financial professionals. Proponents argue that it is necessary to combat tax evasion by U,S. taxpayors and to increase transparency and cooperation between the U.S. and other countries.

The IRS has provided guidance on the implementation of FATCA, including a list of participating FFI's and a list of non-participating FFI's. The IRS has also provided guidance on the procedures for filing Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, and Form 8966, Statement of Foreign Financial Assets.

FATCA has been the subject of much discussion and controversy, and its impact on the financial industry is still being debated. The law has been criticized for imposing a significant compliance burden on financial institutions, and for creating confusion and difficulties for non-U,S. financial professionals. However, proponents argue that it is necessary to prevent tax evasion by U,S, taxpayers and to increase transparency and collaboration between the U,S. and other countries.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.000, 0.181, 0.624] Agent refined response: The colonists had a problem with the Tea Act of 1773 because it was seen as an attempt by the British government to exert greater control over the colonies and to tax them without their consent. The Act imposed a tax on tea imported into the colonies, and allowed the British East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonies, bypassing local merchants. The colonists were already resentful of the taxes imposed on them by the British government, and saw the Tea Act as an attempt to further exploit them. The Act was also seen as a violation of their rights as British subjects, as they were not consulted on the matter and had no representation in Parliament. The colonists were particularly angry about the tax on tea, as it was seen as a luxury item and the tax would make it more expensive for the colonists to buy. The colonists were also angry about the fact that the tax was imposed without their consent, and they saw it as an attempt to force them to buy tea from the British East India Company, rather than from other sources.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.069, 0.207, 0.599] Agent refined response: The secretory cells of endocrine organs, also known as endocrine glands, secrete their hormones into the bloodstream. The hormones produced by endocrine glands are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to reach their target cells, which are located in other parts of the body. The hormones are released into the bloodstream through the process of exocytosis, in which the cell membrane fuses with the plasma membrane of the cell and the hormone is released.

Ground truth: The Beer Hall Putsch, also known as the Munich Putsch, and, in German, as the Hitlerputsch, Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch, Bürgerbräu-Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle, was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler--along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders--to seize power in Munich, Bavaria, during 8--9 November 1923. About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers. Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, Hitler was arrested and charged with treason.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.
[0.061, 0.241, 0.582] Agent refined response: "Beware the Ides of March" is a famous phrase from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar (Act 1, Scene 1). It is spoken by the soothsayer to Caesar, and is a warning to him to beware of danger on the Ides of March, which is the 15th of March in the Roman calendar. The phrase has since become a common idiomatic expression used to warn someone of impending danger or disaster.

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.000, 0.231, 0.620] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss, usually on the top and crown of the head. It is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. The hair follicles are influenced by the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of testosterone, which causes the hair follicles to shrink and eventually stop producing hair. The condition is inherited from one's parents, and the risk of developing male pattern baldness increases with age. Other factors such as stress, poor diet, and certain medical conditions can also contribute to hair loss.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.

To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.033, 0.139, 0.558] Agent refined response: A dieback or population crash occurs when a population of a species experiences a significant decline in its size or density, often resulting in a decrease in its overall fitness and survival. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including environmental changes, disease, predation, competition, and other factors.

Some common causes of population crashes include:

1. Habitat loss or fragmentation: When a species' habitat is destroyed or broken up, it can lead to a decline in population size.
2. Overhunting: When a species is hunted excessively, it can lead to a declining population.
3. Disease: Diseases can spread quickly and cause significant mortality in a population, leading to a decline in numbers.
4. Parasites: Parasites can also spread quickly and cause significant mortality, particularly in small populations.
5. Competition: When a species is outcompeted by another species, it can lead to a decling population.
6. Climate change: Climate change can lead to changes in the environment that make it more difficult for a species to survive.
7. Human activities: Human activities such as land use changes, pollution, and introduction of invasive species can also lead to population decline.
8. Natural fluctuations: Some species exhibit natural fluctuations in population size, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including changes in food availability, weather patterns, and other environmental factors.

The time frame for a dieback or population crash can vary depending on the cause and the population size. For example, a population crash can occur in a matter of months or years, or it can take decades or even centuries for a population to recover.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.068, 0.250, 0.598] Agent refined response: The cones are located in the retina, which is the innermost layer of the eye. The retina is a layer of light-sensitive cells that lines the inside of the eye and converts light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. The cones are responsible for color vision and are found in the fovea, a small area in the center of the retina. The cones are organized into three types, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light, allowing for color vision.

In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.020, 0.219, 0.599] Agent refined response: Connective tissue is found throughout the body, but it is particularly abundant in the musculoskeletal system, the nervous system, and the circulatory system. It is also found in the skin, bones, cartilage, and tendons.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.000, 0.202, 0.563] Agent refined response: April Fools' Day, also known as All Fools' Day, is a day celebrated on 1 April by playing practical jokes and spreading hoaxes. The jokes and their targets, often exaggerated claims, are repeated in the media, the Internet, and in other forms of communication. The jokes are often at the expense of the gullible and the unwary. The term "April Fools' Day" was also used in a 1539 proclamation by King Henry VIII of England.

Prompt: name of black man in to kill a mockingbird
Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.
[0.000, 0.120, 0.529] Agent refined response: In the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee, the character of Atticus Finch is a lawyer who defends a black man named Tom Robinson, who is falsely accused of rape.

Prompt: where did the santa fe trail take emigrants
Ground truth: The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century transportation route through central North America that connected Independence, Missouri with Santa Fe, New Mexico. Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell, it served as a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to Santa Fe in 1880. Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro which carried trade from Mexico City.

It was used by thousands of emigrants, traders, and settlers from the United States and Mexico during the period of westward expansion of the United States. The trail was established in 1821 and was used for the next 29 years.

The Santa Fe Trail was a major route for the transportation of goods, including food, clothing, and weapons, as well as for the transportation of people, including settlers, traders, and travelers. It was also used by the U.S. military during the Mexican-American War.

The trail began in the Kansas City area, where it connected with the Santa Fe Trail, which was used by traders and settlers from the Missouri River to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The trail was originally used by the Spanish and Mexican traders, but it was later used by the United States Army during the Mexican-American War. The trail was also used by the Mormons during their migration to Utah.

The Santa Fe Trails were used by emigrants from the east coast, including the United States and Europe, who wanted to settle in the West. They were also used by traders who wanted to trade with the Native American tribes and by the U.S. military who wanted to protect the settlers and traders.

The trail was also used by the Santa Fe Expedition, which was a military expedition led by Stephen Watts Kearny in 1846. The expedition was the first military force to enter New Mexico during the Mexican-American War.

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.
[0.000, 0.220, 0.558] Agent refined response: Chocolate originated in the Americas, specifically in the regions of Central and South America, not in Spain or Asia.

Prompt: bible verse taking the lord's name in vain
Ground truth: It is a prohibition of blasphemy, specifically, the misuse or "taking in vain" of the name of the God of Israel, or using His name to commit evil. Exodus 20: 7 reads:
[0.020, 0.120, 0.575] Agent refined response: The Bible does not use the term "taking the Lord's name in vain" in the same way that it is used in modern English. However, there are several verses that discuss the use of God's name in various contexts.

Exodus 20:7 is one of the most well-known verses on the subject, where God says, "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold guiltless anyone who takes the name of the Lord your God."

Deuteronomy 5:11 also says, "You shall not take God's name in vain, for God's name is holy."

In these verses, the Hebrew word translated as "name" is shem (Hebrew: שם), which refers to the name of God or the reputation of God. The idea is that one should not use God's name lightly or irreverently, as if it were a common thing or a curse word.

In the New Testament, Jesus teaches his disciples to pray in the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be your name" (Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2). This is a prayer for God's name to be revered and honored, and for God's kingdom to come.

In summary, the Bible teaches that God's name is holy and should be treated with reverence and respect. Using God's name in a disrespectful or irreverent manner is considered a sin.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.068, 0.278, 0.615] Agent refined response: The heart begins to develop around 2 weeks after fertilization, when the embryo first forms. The first heart tube forms and begins to beat around 5 weeks, and the first heart valves form around 6 weeks. The heart begins to pump blood around 7 weeks, when the first blood vessels form. The heart develops from the third and fourth somites, which are groups of cells that form along the back of the embryo. The heart is initially a tube-like structure, and then develops into a four-chambered organ with a muscular wall. The heart is the first organ to begin beating, and it continues to beat throughout life.

Prompt: where does decussation occur in the spinothalamic pathway
Ground truth: The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.
[0.048, 0.223, 0.611] Agent refined response: Decussation, or crossing, of the spinothalamic tract occurs in the spinal cord. The spinothalamic tract is a major pathway for sensory information from the body to the brain, and it is involved in the transmission of pain, temperature, and pressure sensations.

The spinal cord is divided into three regions: the cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), and lumbar (lower back) regions. The spinothalamic fibers enter the spinal cord through the ventral (front) aspect of the spinal cord and exit through the dorsal (back) aspect.

In the cervical region, the spinothalamic fibers cross from the left to the right side of the spinal cord. In the thoracic and lumbar regions, the fibers cross from the right to the left side. This crossing of the fibers is called decussation.

The decussation of the spinothalamic fibres occurs in the grey matter of the spinal cord. The grey matter is a layer of nerve cells that transmit signals to and from the brain. The fibers that are decussated are those that are involved in the transmission of sensory information from the body to other parts of the nervous system.

In the cervico-thoracic region, the decussation of the spinothalaamic fibers occurs in the spinal cord's grey matter. In the lumbar region, the decussation occurs in the spinal cord' s lateral funiculus.

The decussation is an important feature of the spinal cord, as it allows for the efficient transmission of sensory information from the periphery to the brain.

Prompt: who propounded the idea of basic education in india
Ground truth: The pedagogic goals of Basic Education by Mahatma Gandhi are general and complex pedagogic targets and conrete pedagogic targets. The general targets are lifelong education, social education and integral education. The conrete pedagogic targets are craftwork, native language, co-education, the village community, hygiene-the Programme of safai-and reading and writing.
[0.000, 0.100, 0.477] Agent refined response: The concept of basic education in India can be traced back to the ancient Indian education system, which was based on the principles of the Vedic period. The Vedic texts, such as the Vedas and the Upanishads, laid the foundation for the ancient Indian education system, which included the study of the Vedas, the Vedic rituals, and the principles of dharma.

However, the modern concept of basic education in India was first proposed by Mahatma Gandhi in the early 20th century. Gandhi believed that education should be accessible to all, regardless of social class or economic status, and that it should be focused on developing the moral and ethical values of the individual. He advocated for a system of education that would provide a basic education to all children, including those in rural areas, and that would emphasize the development of character and moral values.

Gandhi's ideas were further developed by other educationists, such as Rabindranath Tagore, who founded Visva-Bharati University in 1921, and Jawaharlal Nehru, who became the first Prime Minister of India in 1947. Nehru believed that education was essential for the development of a modern, secular, and democratic society, and he advocated for a system of education based on the principles of Gandhi and Tagore.

In 1968, the Indian government established the National Policy on Education, which aimed to provide universal access to education and to promote literacy and education for all. The policy emphasized the importance of basic education, which was defined as education up to the age of 14 or 15, and included primary education, as well as upper primary education.

Since then, the Indian government has continued to develop and implement policies aimed at improving access to education and promoting basic education. In 2009, the Right to Education Act was passed, which made education a fundamental right for all children between the ages of 6 and 14. The act aimed to improve access to education and to reduce dropout rates, particularly among girls and children from disadvantaged communities.

Overall, the concept of basic education in India has evolved over time, from the ancient Indian education system to the modern policies aimed at improving access and promoting literacy and education for all.

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison. The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution, which replaced hanging.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.
[0.025, 0.138, 0.540] Agent refined response: The Virginia Colony was established in 1607 and was the first successful English settlement in North America. The colony was established as a joint-stock company, the Virginia Company of London, which was granted a charter by King James I to establish a colony in North America. The colony's early years were marked by conflict with the Powhatan Confederacy, a powerful Native American alliance that controlled much of the coastal region. The colony was established primarily as a commercial venture, with the goal of generating profits through the export of tobacco, which became a major crop in the colony.

The religion of the Virginia Colony was Anglicanism, which was the established religion of England at the time. The colony was settled by English Puritans, who were members of the Church of England and sought to purify the Church of England from Roman Catholic and Anglican practices. The Puritans believed that the Church of England was corrupt and sought to establish a pure, independent church in the New World.

The Virginia General Assembly, the colony's legislative body, was dominated by Anglicans, and the Church of England was the official religion of the colony. However, there were also Quakers, Catholics, and other religious minorities in the colony. The colony's religious diversity was a source of conflict, and the colony's leaders sought to suppress the religious practices of those who were not Anglicans.

In 1629, the General Assembly passed the Act of Toleration, which allowed for the free exercise of religion, but only for those who were members of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England, or the Church of Rome. This act was intended to suppress the growth of other religious groups, such as the Quakers and the Baptists, who were seen as a threat to the established order.

Overall, the religion of the Virginia Colony was predominantly Anglican, but there were also other religious groups present in the colony, and the colony's religious diversity contributed to its conflicts and tensions.

Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism.

Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas.

The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March."

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.295, 0.439, 0.195, 0.272, 0.618] Agent refined response: The cones are the light-sensitive cells in the retina of the eye. They are located in the outer layer of the retina, called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and are responsible for color vision and high visual acuity. The cones are concentrated in the fovea, a small area in the center of the retina, and are responsible for color vision. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light, which allows for color vision.

Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.454, 0.430, 0.135, 0.211, 0.588] Agent refined response: Muhammad (570--632 CE) is widely regarded as the founder of Islam.

He received his first revelation from God through the angel Gabriel when he was 40, and received revelations over a period of 23 years, which later became known as the Qur'an. Muhammad's teachings emphasized the unity of God, and that all people are equal in the eyes of God, regardless of their race, gender or social status. He also emphasized the importance of compassion, justice and the importance of living a righteous life. He is considered by Muslims to be the last in a line of prophets including Abraham, Moses and Jesus, and his teachings form the basis of Islam.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.359, 0.391, 0.085, 0.233, 0.601] Agent refined response: The term "eye of round" refers to the area of the roast where the roast's muscles are located, particularly the area between the ribs. The eye of round is located on the underside of the roast, and is so named because it resembles the eye of an animal. It is a cut of beef from the hindquarters of the animal, and is often considered to be a less tender cut than other cuts of beef. It is typically used for roasting, and is often seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices before cooking.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.316, 0.302, 0.047, 0.163, 0.587] Agent refined response: A bullet is a type of projectile and its trajectory depends on the initial velocity, angle of launch, air resistance, and gravity. When fired in the air, the bullet follows a parabolic path, and it will eventually reach the ground if it is not intercepted by another bullet or object. The bullet will experience air resistance, which will slow it down and cause it to drop in altitude. The bullet will also experience a force due to gravity, which will cause it to accelerate towards the ground.

This phrase has been the subject of debate and interpretation for centuries, but is not a specific constitutional right. The Constitution of the United States (1787) does not include the phrase "right to life, liberty, and the pursuit happiness." However, the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution (1868) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (1791) have been interpreted to protect individual rights, including the right to life, liberty, and the enjoyment of property. The Supreme Court has also recognized a right to privacy and reproductive rights, which are based on the idea that the right to life includes the right to make decisions about one's own body and reproductive choices.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.251, 0.400, 0.149, 0.278, 0.599] Agent refined response: The cones are the light-sensitive cells in the retina of the eye that are responsible for color vision and high visual acuity. They are located in the fovea, which is the central part of the retina. The fovea is a small, specialized area in the center of the retina that contains only cones and no rods. The cones are organized in a mosaic pattern, with each cone sensitive to a different range of the visible spectrum, resulting in color vision.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.331, 0.366, 0.046, 0.217, 0.572] Agent refined response: The heart begins to form during the third week of embryonic development, when the embryo is called a blastocyst. The blastocyst is a hollow ball of cells, with an inner cell mass that will eventually form the embryo and an outer layer of cells that will eventually form the placenta and other supporting tissues. The inner cell mass begins to differentiate into two layers of cells: the epiblast and the hypoblast. The epiblast will eventually form the embryo proper, including the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, which are the three primary germ layers. The hypoblast will eventually form the placenta, yolk sac, and amniotic sac.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.

Ground truth: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying.

After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.173, 0.246, 0.062, 0.154, 0.545] Agent refined response: 1.5 The trajectory of a bullet is affected by gravity, wind resistance, air density, and air pressure. A bullet fired at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal will follow a parabolic path, and a bullet fired vertically will follow a hyperbolic path.

Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.

Ground truth: El Pollo Loco is the name of two independent restaurant chains that are controlled by different companies, El Pollo Loco, Inc. and El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. Both companies specialize in Mexican-style grilled chicken and were founded by Juan Francisco Ochoa.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.101, 0.364, 0.158, 0.221, 0.667] Agent refined response: Connective tissue is a type of animal tissue that supports and connects other tissues and organs.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.

Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism. Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.

Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.

Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.

Ground truth: The Beer Hall Putsch, also known as the Munich Putsch, and, in German, as the Hitlerputsch, Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch, Bürgerbräu-Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle, was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler--along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders--to seize power in Munich, Bavaria, during 8--9 November 1923. About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers. Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, Hitler was arrested and charged with treason.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.

To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.212, 0.328, 0.066, 0.175, 0.543] Agent refined response: 1 April is celebrated as a day of pranks and hoaxes worldwide, known as April Fools' Day.

Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London.

Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.370, 0.392, 0.118, 0.172, 0.583] Agent refined response: The term "dog and pony show" is believed to have originated in the late 19th century in the United States. There are several theories as to how it came to be used to describe a political speech or a presentation, but the most widely accepted explanation is that it was originally used in traveling medicine shows.

In these shows, a traveling salesman would sell patent medicines and other health remedies, often accompanied by a trained dog and a pony. The dog and pony were used to entertain the audience and to help sell the medicines, which were often exaggerated or fraudulent. Over time, the term "dog and pony show," which was originally used to describe these traveling medicine shows, came to be used more broadly to describe any presentation or speech that was seen as being overly flashy or entertaining, but lacking in substance.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.345, 0.381, 0.082, 0.219, 0.571] Agent refined response: The founder of Islam is the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Quran, the holy book of Islam, was revealed to him by Allah (God) through the angel Gabriel, and he is considered the final prophet in a line of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Muhammad received the first revelation of the Quran in the year 610 CE and continued to receive revelations until his death in 632 CE. He is considered the most important figure in Islam and is revered by Muslims as the "Seal of the Prophets," signifying the end of a line of prophets and the finality of his message.

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.
[0.373, 0.474, 0.192, 0.276, 0.639] Agent refined response: The Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or the Via Dolorosa, are 14 scenes or stops along a Catholic pilgrimage route that commemorate the last day of Jesus Christ's life, from his sentencing to his death by crucifixion. The origins of the Stations of the Cross can be traced back to the early Christian Church, but the current version was formalized in the 12th century by Saint Francis of Assisi.

According to tradition, Saint Francis was inspired by a vision of Jesus' passion and death, and he created the first Stations of the Cross as a way for himself and other Christians to meditate on the events of Jesus' final day. The Stations were originally marked by crosses or markers, and the devotion spread throughout Europe and beyond.

The Stations of the Cross are typically found in Catholic churches and are usually located along a path or walkway. The 14 stations are as follows:

1. Jesus is condemned to death by Pontius Pilate
2. Jesus is made to carry his cross
3. Jesus meets his mother, Mary, on the way to Calvary

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.219, 0.245, 0.073, 0.152, 0.606] Agent refined response: The limit of a function does not exist when the function does not have a well-defined value at a given point. In other words, the limit of a function is a concept that only makes sense when the function is defined and continuous at a point. If the function is not defined or is discontinuous at a point, then the limit of the function does not exist.

There are several reasons why the limit of a function may not exist, including:

1. The function is not defined at a point: If the function is not defined at a particular point, then the limit of the functional at that point does not exist. For example, if the function f(x) = 0 for all x except x = 0, then the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 does not exist.
2. The function is discontinuous at a point: If the function has a discontinuity at a point, then the limit as x approaches that point does not exist. For instance, if the function f(x,y) = (x^2, y^2) has a discontinuity at the point (0,0), then the limit of f(x,y) as (x,

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.342, 0.359, 0.100, 0.242, 0.579] Agent refined response: Thank you for asking! The term "eye of the round roast" is a cut of beef that comes from the hindquarters of the animal, near the hip.

The round roast is a popular cut of beef because it is lean and tender, making it easy to cook and flavorful. It is often roasted or grilled and served as a main course or as a side dish. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.077, 0.248, 0.090, 0.177, 0.598] Agent refined response: Bullets fired in the air are affected by gravity and will fall back to the ground. They will not disappear or "go away" as they are solid objects.

Prompt: where does the saying keeping up with the jones come from
Ground truth: The phrase originates with the comic strip Keeping Up with the Joneses, created by Arthur R. "Pop" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in The New York World and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were unseen characters throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom keeping up with the Joneses has remained popular long after the strip's end.
[0.261, 0.322, 0.140, 0.227, 0.608] Agent refined response: The saying "keeping up with the Joneses" is believed to have originated in the late 19th century in the United States. The term "Jones" was used as a placeholder name to represent a fictional rival family who were perceived to be wealthier and more successful than the speaker's own family. The phrase was often used to describe the anxiety or pressure of trying to keep up with the perceived social status of the Joneses, who were often portrayed as a wealthy and influential family.

The origins of the phrase are shrouded in mystery, but one theory is that it was coined by a newspaper editor named Edward William Bok, who used the name "Jones" in a series of articles in the New York World newspaper in the late 1800s. Bok wrote about the fictional Jones family, who were portrayed as a wealthy and cultured family who were able to afford the latest fashions, gadgets, and luxuries. The phrase "keeping up with the Jones" was first used in the 1890s and quickly became a common expression in American English.

Prompt: where are trigger points located in the body
Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.
[0.186, 0.198, 0.054, 0.129, 0.524] Agent refined response: Trigger points are specific areas of muscle tissue that have been identified as being associated with pain and dysfunction.

Prompt: who was the ottoman governor who led egypt in the years following the napoleonic wars
Ground truth: Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province. It was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in 1867. Isma'il Pasha and Tewfik Pasha governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty until the British occupation of 1882. Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867--1914) remained a de jure Ottoman province until 5 November 1914, when it was declared a British protectorate in reaction to the decision of the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers.

He joined the Ottoman army as a young man and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the Ottoman governor of Egypt in 1805. During his tenure, he implemented a number of modernizing reforms, including the abolition of slavery, the establishment of a modern bureaucracy, and the promotion of agriculture and trade. He also expanded Egypt's territory through military campaigns in the Sudan and the Levant.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.435, 0.426, 0.122, 0.230, 0.602] Agent refined response: The term "pop music" is believed to have originated in the late 19th century, as a way to describe popular music as opposed to classical music. The term "pop" was used to indicate that the music was intended for a wide audience, and was not limited to the elite or classical music fans.

The term "pop music" was first used in the 1880s in the United States, where it was used to describe the popular music of the time, which was characterized by its catchy melodies and simple harmonies. The term was later adopted in the UK in the 1950s, where it became the dominant term for popular music.

Over time, the term "pop music" has evolved to encompass a wide range of styles, including rock, pop-rock, dance-pop, and contemporary R&B. Today, the term is used to describe a diverse range of music genres, from Taylor Swift's country-pop to Drake's hip-hop-infused R&B.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.

The hypothalamus is a small region located at the base of the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including the production of hormones. The anterior pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland located at the base of the brain, which is responsible for producing and secreting hormones that regulate various bodily functions, such as growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive function. The hormones produced by the anterior pituitary are synthesized in the hypothalamus and then secreted into the bloodstream for distribution to other parts of the body.

Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.
[0.189, 0.211, 0.053, 0.114, 0.536] Agent refined response: The first vaccine for whooping cough, also known as pertussis, was developed in the early 20th century. The first pertussis vaccine was developed in the 1920s by Dr. Thomas Rivers at the University of Michigan. The vaccine was made from a weakened form of the bacteria that causes whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis.

The first pertussis vaccine became available for use in the United States in the 1930s, and it was included in the childhood vaccination schedule in the 1940s. The vaccine was initially given as a whole-cell vaccine, which contained the entire bacteria. In the 1950s, a new form of the vaccine called the "acellular" vaccine was developed. This vaccine contains only a small part of the bacteria, which is less likely to cause a severe reaction.

Since then, the pertussis vaccine has been updated and improved several times, with new formulations and booster doses added to the vaccination schedule.

Prompt: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria
Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.358, 0.425, 0.101, 0.194, 0.611] Agent refined response: The Colonists had a problem with the Tea Act of 1773 for several reasons:

1. Monopoly: The Tea Act granted a monopoly to the East India Company, allowing them to sell tea directly to the colonies without having to deal with local merchants. This was seen as a violation of the colonists' rights and a threat to their economic independence.
2. Taxation without representation: The Tea Act imposed taxes on tea sold in the colonies, but the colonists had no representation in Parliament to advocate for their interests. This was a common grievance among the colonists, who felt that they were being taxed without having any say in how their government was run.
3. British control: The Tea Act was seen as another example of the British government exerting its control over the colonies, without respecting their rights or allowing them to govern themselves. The colonists felt that they were being treated as subjects of the British crown, rather than as independent citizens.
4. Symbol of resistance: The Tea Act became a symbol of resistance against British rule, as the colonists refused to comply with the law and boycotted tea

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.116, 0.219, 0.080, 0.179, 0.598] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common form of hair loss in men. It is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. The main culprit behind male pattern baldness is the presence of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced in the body and is responsible for the development of male characteristics such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle mass. However, it can also contribute to hair loss by shrinking the hair follicles and causing them to stop producing hair.

Other factors that can contribute to male pattern baldness include:

1. Genetics: Male pattern baldness tends to run in families, so if your parents or grandparents experienced hair loss, you may be more likely to experience it as well.
2. Age: Male pattern baldness typically begins in the late 20s or early 30s and progresses with age.
3. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormone levels, such as an excess of DHT, can contribute to hair loss.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.

To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.217, 0.297, 0.055, 0.164, 0.537] Agent refined response: A dieback or population crash occurs when a species' population declines rapidly and significantly, often resulting in a sharp decline in the population's size or even extinction. There are many reasons why a dieback or population crash may occur, including:

1. Habitat loss or destruction: Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture can lead to the destruction of natural habitats, causing populations to decline.
2. Overexploitation: Overhunting, overfishing, and overharvesting of plants can lead to a decline in population size as the species is unable to sustain itself.
3. Pollution: Chemical pollutants, such as pesticides, herbicides, and industrial waste, can have a toxic effect on species populations, leading to a decline in their numbers.
4. Climate change: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter the distribution and abundance of species, leading to a decline in population size.
5. Disease: Viruses, bacteria, and fungi can all have a significant impact on species populations, leading to a dieback or crash.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.295, 0.340, 0.171, 0.255, 0.563] Agent refined response: The three layers of the meninges are:

1. Dura mater: The outermost layer of the meninges, the dura mater is a thick, fibrous membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord. It is attached to the skull and spinal column, and provides protection and support to the brain and spinal cord.
2. Arachnoid mater: The middle layer of the meninges, called the arachnoid mater, is a delicate membrane that is richly supplied with blood vessels. It is divided into several layers, each with a distinct function. The outermost layer of the arachnoid mater is called the periosteal layer, and it is in contact with the skull and bones of the skull. The innermost layer is called the meningeal layer, and it is in direct contact with the brain.
3. Pia mater: The innermost layer of the meninges, known as the pia mater, is a delicate membranous layer that closely adheres to the surface of the brain. It is composed of endothelial cells and provides a close, protective covering for the brain. The pia mater

Prompt: what states do not allow daylight savings time
Ground truth: Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year, so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time (DST), the exceptions being Arizona (except for the Navajo, who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands), Hawaii, and the overseas territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US.
[0.212, 0.340, 0.140, 0.226, 0.601] Agent refined response: There are two states in the United States that do not observe Daylight Saving Time (DST): Hawaii and Arizona. Hawaii is exempt from DST because it is located near the equator and has a relatively consistent amount of daylight throughout the year. Arizona does not observe DST because the state legislature decided not to participate in the practice.

Prompt: when did the nba add the three point line
Ground truth: In the 1979--80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.
[0.342, 0.389, 0.183, 0.292, 0.604] Agent refined response: The NBA added the three-point line in the 1979-80 season. The league introduced the three-point line to create more scoring opportunities and to speed up the game. The three-point line was set at 23 feet, 9 inches from the center of the basket, and it was only used in the NBA Finals during the 1979-1980 season. The three-point line was made official for the regular season in the 1980-81 season.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.271, 0.365, 0.134, 0.216, 0.578] Agent refined response: The cones in the eye are located in the retina, which is the innermost layer of the eye. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. The cones are responsible for color vision and are found in the central part of the retina, known as the macula. The macula is a small, specialized area of the retina that is responsible for central vision and is responsible for activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.

Prompt: who is the founder of el pollo loco
Ground truth: El Pollo Loco is the name of two independent restaurant chains that are controlled by different companies, El Pollo Loco, Inc. and El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. Both companies specialize in Mexican-style grilled chicken and were founded by Juan Francisco Ochoa. Ochoa established the first El Pollo Loco restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in the mid-1970s, and then expanded his chain into the United States in 1980. Ochoa then sold his U.S. restaurants in 1983, which became El Pollo Loco, Inc., while keeping the ones in Mexico, which became El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. Both companies have since occupied non-overlapping global territories, and have offered different fare.
[0.321, 0.327, 0.110, 0.209, 0.565] Agent refined response: El Pollo Loco is a fast-food restaurant chain that was founded by Larry Lavine in 1975 in Los Angeles, California. Lavine, a former business student and avid golfer, started the chain as a small take-out restaurant in a strip mall in Los Angeles. He named the restaurant "El Pollo Loco" (which means "the crazy chicken" in Spanish) because he had the idea of cooking chicken in a pressure fryer to create a crispy, juicy chicken breast. The restaurant quickly gained popularity for its flame-grilled chicken and became a successful chain with over 400 locations in the United States and internationally.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.280, 0.331, 0.099, 0.225, 0.584] Agent refined response: Connective tissue is found throughout the body and makes up a significant portion of the human body. It is found in the following areas:

1. Bones: Connective tissue is found in the bones, particularly in the bone marrow, where it helps to produce blood cells.
2. Muscles: Connective tissue is found between muscle fibers, where it helps to provide support and stability to the muscles.
3. Joints: Connective tissue is found around the joints, where it helps to cushion and support the joints and provide stability to the surrounding muscles and bones.
4. Blood vessels: Connective tissue is found surrounding blood vessels, where it helps to protect and support the vessels.
5. Nerves: Connective tissue is found near nerves, where it helps to protect and insulate the nerves.
6. Skin: Connective tissue is found beneath the skin, where it helps to provide support, stability, and protection to the skin.
7. Eyes: Connective tissue is found within the eyes, particularly in the retina, where it helps to support the retinal cells.

Prompt: where do pineapples come from in the world
Ground truth: Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in five to ten months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest. In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
[0.241, 0.306, 0.065, 0.178, 0.559] Agent refined response: Pineapples are native to South America, with their origin believed to be in the Amazon region of Brazil. The wild pineapple plant is thought to have originated in the southeastern Amazon, particularly in the states of Pará and Amapá. The pineapple as we know it today is believed to have been cultivated by the indigenous people of South America over 3,000 years ago. From there, pineapples were introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the Americas in 1493. Since then, pineapples have been cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including Hawaii, Costa Rica, and the Philippines.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.273, 0.327, 0.028, 0.178, 0.525] Agent refined response: In the tradition of April Fools' Day, it is a common joke to continue playing pranks and tricks on people until noon, as the "official" time for the day's festivities. However, the exact time when April Fools' Day ends is subjective and varies from person to person. Some people may choose to continue the fun and games until the early afternoon, while others may call it quits after the first hour or two. Ultimately, the duration of April Fools' Day is up to the individual and their sense of humor.

Prompt: name of black man in to kill a mockingbird
Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.
[0.255, 0.301, 0.041, 0.137, 0.509] Agent refined response: I'm not able to provide information that could be used to identify a specific individual, including a black man, as it is not appropriate or respectful to share personal information without consent. Additionally, it is important to recognize that every person has the right to privacy and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

In the context of Harper Lee's novel "To Kill a Mockingbird," the character Tom Robinson is a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white woman. The novel explores themes of racial injustice and discrimination in the Deep South during the 1930s, and Tom's trial and subsequent conviction serve as a pivotal moment in the story.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x.

More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.298, 0.360, 0.073, 0.187, 0.589] Agent refined response: The trajectory of a bullet fired in the air depends on several factors, including the type of bullet, the air density, and the initial velocity. In general, when a bullet is fired in the air, it will follow a ballistic trajectory, which means that it will start to descend after reaching its highest point.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.467, 0.485, 0.144, 0.253, 0.600] Agent refined response: The term pop music is believed to have originated in the late 19th century, when a new genre of music emerged in the United States that was characterized by its catchy melodies and popular appeal. This genre was distinct from the more formal and classical music of the time, and was instead aimed at a mass audience.

The term "pop music" was first used in the 1920s to describe the new popular music that was emerging, and it was initially used interchangeably with the term "light music." The term "pop music" was later popularized in the 1950s and 1960s, as the genre became more defined and commercially successful.

The origins of pop music can be traced back to a variety of sources, including early forms of popular music such as jazz, blues, and country. Pop music also drew on the emerging popular music styles of the time, such as rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and rock music.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.354, 0.426, 0.149, 0.235, 0.608] Agent refined response: The Tea Act of 1773 was a law passed by the British Parliament to regulate the production and distribution of tea in the American colonies. The colonists had several problems with the Tea Act, which further fueled their growing animosity towards British rule. Here are some of the main reasons why the colonists had a problem with the Tea Act:

1. Taxation without representation: The Tea Act required the colonies to pay a tax on all tea imported into the colonies, without giving them any representation in Parliament. This was a violation of their rights as British subjects, as they were not allowed to participate in the decision-making process that affected their lives.
2. Restrictions on trade: The Tea Act granted a monopoly on the importation of tea to the East India Company, which was a British trading company. This meant that the colonists could only buy tea from the East India Company, and not from other sources. This restriction on trade was seen as an attempt to control the colonies economically.
3. Disrespect for colonial autonomy: The Tea Act was seen as an example of the British government's tendency to disregard

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.

To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.

Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.
[0.301, 0.363, 0.067, 0.193, 0.573] Agent refined response: Chocolate has a rich history that spans across multiple cultures and continents.

The Olmecs are believed to have made a drink from ground cacao beans, which they mixed with water, honey, and other ingredients.

From Mesoamerica, chocolate spread to other parts of the Americas, including the Mayans and Aztecs. The Mayans consumed chocolate as a drink and used it in religious rituals, while the Aztecs used it as a form of currency and as a drink for the elite. The Aztecs also developed a more refined form of chocolate, known as xocoatl, which was made by grinding the beans with water and spices.

Chocolate was introduced to Europe by the Spanish in the 16

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.250, 0.356, 0.103, 0.229, 0.609] Agent refined response: The heart begins as a tube-like structure called the heart tube or cardiogenic diverticulum, which forms in the fifth week of embryonic development. As the embryo grows, the heart tube starts to fold in on itself, eventually forming the four chambers of the heart: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle.

At about the 22nd day of embryonic development, the heart begins to beat, starting with a rhythmic contraction of the ventricles. This early heartbeat is called the "primitive heart rhythm." It is a slow, irregular rhythm that is not yet synchronized with the rest of the body.

As the embryo grows, the muscles of the heart begin to develop and become more organized. The heart's electrical conduction system, which is responsible for coordinating the heart's rhythm, begins to develop around the 25th day of embryonic development.

By the 28th day of embryonic development, all four chambers of the heart are fully formed, and the heart is pumping blood

Prompt: when was the biltmore house opened to the public
Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism. Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.

Prompt: what do the 3 dots mean in math
Ground truth: In logical argument and mathematical proof, the therefore sign (∴) is generally used before a logical consequence, such as the conclusion of a syllogism. The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read therefore. It is encoded at U + 2234 ∴ therefore (HTML & # 8756; &there4;). For common use in Microsoft Office hold the ALT key and type "8756". While it is not generally used in formal writing, it is used in mathematics and shorthand. It is complementary to U + 2235 ∵ because (HTML & # 8757;).
[0.210, 0.254, 0.016, 0.167, 0.490] Agent refined response: The three dots in math, also known as the "Cauchy sequence," are used to indicate that a sequence of numbers is getting closer and closer to a specific value. The three dots are often written as follows:

$$\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = L$$

In this notation, $a_n$ represents the $n$th term of the sequence, and $L$ represents the limit or value that the sequence approaches as $n$ approaches infinity.

For example, consider the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, ... . The limit of this sequence as $n$ approaches infinity is 4, which means that the sequence gets closer and closer to 4 as $n$ gets larger and larger.

The use of the three dots in math is a way to indicate that a sequence is convergent, or that it approaches a specific value as $n$ approaches infinity. This is an important concept in calculus and other branches of mathematics, as it allows mathematicians to study the behavior of sequences and series as they approach infinity.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.313, 0.362, 0.101, 0.202, 0.597] Agent refined response: The term "dog and pony show" is believed to have originated in the late 19th century in the United States. The term is thought to have come from the practice of traveling circuses and medicine shows, which would often feature a dog and a pony as part of their acts. These acts were often used to entertain and captivate audiences, and the term "dog and pony show” eventually became a colloquialism for any kind of show or performance that was considered to be overly elaborate or excessive.

The term "dog and pony show' has also been used to describe a variety of other things, including political campaigns, advertising campaigns, and business presentations. In these contexts, the term is often used to describe a showy or flashy display that is intended to impress or persuade an audience, but may not necessarily be based on substance or merit.

Overall, the term "dog and pony shows" has a long and varied history, and its meaning and connotations have evolved over time. Today, it is often used in a somewhat negative or dismissive way to describe something that is seen as overly flashy or

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.388, 0.413, 0.117, 0.277, 0.602] Agent refined response: The founder of Islam is Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). He was born in Mecca, Arabia in 570 CE and received his first revelation from Allah (God) through the angel Gabriel when he was 40 years old. Over the next 23 years, he received a series of revelations that were later compiled into the Quran, the holy book of Islam.

Prophet Muhammad's teachings emphasized the importance of monotheism, social justice, and compassion. He preached a message of unity and equality among all people, regardless of their race, gender, or social status. He also emphasized the importance of leading a righteous life, treating others with kindness and respect, and fulfilling one's obligations to God and society.

Prophet Muhammad is considered by Muslims to be the last in a line of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and his teachings form the basis of Islam. He is revered by Muslims as the greatest of all prophets and is often referred to as the "Seal of the Prophets."

[0.120, 0.139, 0.042, 0.090, 0.459] Agent refined response: Lake Eyre is a large saltwater lake located in the northwestern part of South Australia. It is fed by several rivers, including the Georgina River, the Paralabah Creek, and the Diamantina River. These rivers bring water from the surrounding catchment area, which includes the Great Victoria Desert and the Strzelecki Desert.

The water that fills Lake Eyre is primarily groundwater that has seeped up from the underground aquifer. The lake is located in a region where the water table is relatively high, and the soil is porous and permeable, allowing water to move easily through it. In addition, the lake is also fed by surface water from the surrounding rivers and creeks, which help to maintain its water level.

It's worth noting that Lake Eyre is a very shallow lake, with an average depth of only about 2 meters (6.6 feet). As a result, it is sensitive to changes in the water level and can dry out completely during periods of drought.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.178, 0.197, 0.058, 0.140, 0.563] Agent refined response: A limit of a function does not exist when the function does not approach a value as the input (or independent variable) approaches a certain value. In other words, if the function does not have a well-defined limit at a particular point, then the limit does not exist at that point.

There are several reasons why a limit may not exist, including:

1. The function may not be defined at the point where the limit is being evaluated. For example, if the function has a gap or a discontinuity at that point, then the limit may not exist.
2. The function may not be continuous at the point where the limit is Being evaluated. If the function has a jump discontinuity or a removable discontinuity at that point, Then the limit may not exist.
3. The function may have a infinite or non-finite limit at the point where the limit is been evaluated. This can happen if the function grows or decays exponentially or logarithmically as the input approaches that point.
4. The limit may not exist due to the presence of a vertical asymptote or a horizontal asymptote at the point where the limit is evaluated.
5. The limit may not exist if the function has

Prompt: when did beryl markham fly across the atlantic
Ground truth: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.
[0.423, 0.450, 0.162, 0.191, 0.633] Agent refined response: Beryl Markham, a pioneering aviator, did not fly across the Atlantic Ocean. However, she did make several notable flights in the 1930s, including becoming the first person to fly solo from Britain to North America in 1936.

Markham was born in 1902 in England and began flying in the 1920s. She gained international attention in 1932 when she became the first person to fly from England to Cape Town, South Africa, a distance of over 6,000 miles.

In 1936, Markham made her most famous flight, becoming the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west. She took off from Northolt Airport in London on August 20, 1936, and landed in Nova Scotia, Canada, after a flight of over 20 hours.

Markham's achievements were groundbreaking for a woman in aviation at the time, and she remains an important figure in the history of flight.

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.

The term "round roast" refers to a cut of beef that is taken from the round, which is a muscle located on the hindquarters of a cow. The round is a tougher cut of meat than other cuts, such as the chuck or the loin, and is often slow-cooked or braised to make it tender.

The term "eye of the round," on the other hand, is thought to have been coined by chefs and butchers who wanted to emphasize the tenderness and flavor of the small piece of meat located near the top of the roast. This piece of meat

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.224, 0.287, 0.080, 0.199, 0.593] Agent refined response: Bullets fired in the air do not have a specific destination or target, as they are not designed to hit anything. Instead, they simply follow the trajectory of the weapon from which they were fired, and eventually fall back to the ground due to gravity.

When a bullet is fired in the air, it is subject to the laws of physics, including gravity, air resistance, and the trajectory of the weapon. The bullet will follow a parabolic path, with the highest point of its trajectory being the point of firing, and the lowest point being the point where it hits the ground or disappears from view.

It is important to note that bullets fired in the air can pose a danger to people and property, as they can ricochet or bounce off surfaces and potentially cause injury or damage. It is illegal in many areas to discharge a firearm in a reckless or negligent manner, and it is important to always handle firearms safely and responsibly.

Prompt: where does the saying keeping up with the jones come from
Ground truth: The phrase originates with the comic strip Keeping Up with the Joneses, created by Arthur R. "Pop" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in The New York World and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were unseen characters throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom keeping up with the Joneses has remained popular long after the strip's end.
[0.276, 0.345, 0.131, 0.222, 0.572] Agent refined response: The saying "keeping up with the Joneses" is a common idiom that means to keep pace with or maintain the same level of prosperity or status as someone else, often in reference to one's neighbors or peers. The phrase is thought to have originated in the late 19th or early 20th century in the United States, and is believed to have been popularized by the American humorist and cartoonist, Arthur R. "Bugs" Bunny.

The phrase is often used to describe the competitive nature of suburban life, where people feel pressure to keep up with their neighbors in terms of material possessions, social status, and other markers of success. For example, someone might say "I'm trying to keep up with the Joneses by buying a new car," or "I feel like I'm falling behind the Joneses in terms of my career."

The phrase has become a common cultural reference, and is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe the pressures of keeping up with others in a consumerist society.

Prompt: what proposition made the insurance commissioner an elected position
Ground truth: As a result of the passage of Proposition 103 in 1988, the elected office of the California Insurance Commissioner was created in 1991. Previously, the position was held by a person appointed by the Governor. The Insurance Commissioner oversees the Department of Insurance. Democrat Dave Jones won the November 2, 2010 election for California Insurance Commissioner.
[0.198, 0.332, 0.146, 0.221, 0.615] Agent refined response: The proposition that made the insurance commissioner an election position in the United States was Proposition 103, which was passed in 1988 in California. This proposition, also known as the "Insurance Commissioner Election Act," required that the state insurance commissioner be elected by the voters rather than appointed by the governor or legislature.

Prior to the passage of Proposition 103, the insurance commissioner in California was appointed by the governor, and the position was often seen as a political patronage position. However, the passage of Proposition 102 led to the creation of an elected insurance commissioner, who would be directly accountable to the voters.

The goal of Proposition 103 was to increase transparency and accountability in the insurance industry, and to ensure that the insurance commissioner was more responsive to the needs of consumers. By making the insurance commissioner an elected positions, voters could hold the commissioner accountable for their actions and decisions, and the commissioner would be more likely to prioritize the needs of consumers over the interests of the insurance industry.

Ground truth: Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners.

Prompt: where does the term pop music come from
Ground truth: According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience. since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus (ic), usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc". Grove Music Online also states that ". in the early 1960s, (the term) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music (in England), while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of ' rock and roll '".
[0.373, 0.368, 0.132, 0.211, 0.571] Agent refined response: The term "pop music" originated in the early 20th century, when it was used to describe popular music that was played on the radio and in dance halls. The term "pop" was used to distinguish this type of music from "art music," which was considered more serious and complex.

The origins of pop music can be traced back to the early 1950s, when rock and roll emerged as a fusion of blues, country, and rhythm and blues music. This genre was characterized by its catchy melodies, simple harmonies, and strong rhythms, which made it accessible to a wide audience.

Over time, the term "pop music" came to encompass a wide range of styles, including bubblegum pop, dance-pop, and adult contemporary. Today, pop music is a global phenomenon, with artists from around the world creating and performing pop music in a variety of languages and styles.

Some of the key features of pop music include:

Prompt: is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the constitution
Ground truth: The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".
[0.311, 0.358, 0.133, 0.219, 0.578] Agent refined response: Yes, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental right protected by the United States Constitution. These rights are listed in the Declaration of Independence, which is a document that preceded the Constitution and serves as a statement of the principles upon which the United States was founded.

The Declaration of Independence states that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." These rights are considered inalienable, meaning that they cannot be taken away by any government or authority.

The Constitution also includes several amendments that protect these rights, including the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and religion, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides due process and equal protection under the law.

It is important to note that the right to life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations. For example, the government may restrict certain activities that are deemed harmful to society, such as drug use or violent crime. However, any such restrictions must be carefully balanced to ensure that

Prompt: when did they start vaccinating for whooping cough
Ground truth: Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.
[0.196, 0.202, 0.010, 0.125, 0.513] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the first vaccine for whooping cough, also known as pertussis, was developed in the late 19th century.

The first pertussis vaccine was developed by two American scientists, Edward Anthony and William H. Park, in 1896. They used a weakened form of the bacteria Bordetella pertussis to create the vaccine.

The first pertussIS vaccine was tested in 1904 and was found to be effective in preventing the disease. Since then, several versions of the vaccine have been developed, and it is now a routine childhood vaccine in many countries.

It is important to note that the vaccine is not 100% effective, and some individuals may still contract whooping cough despite being vaccinated. However, the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of severe illness and death from the disease.

Prompt: to whom do the powers not given to the federal government by the constitution go
Ground truth: The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people.
[0.231, 0.316, 0.120, 0.221, 0.596] Agent refined response: According to the searched knowledge, the powers not given to the federal governments by the constitution go to the states or the people.

In the United States, the Constitution divides power between the federal government and the states. The Constitution grants specific powers to the federal government, such as the power to regulate commerce, levy taxes, and declare war. All other powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people.
 
This means that the states have significant authority over matters such as education, law enforcement, and natural resources within their borders. Additionally, the people retain certain rights and powers that are not delegated to the federal government or the states, such as the right to vote, freedom of speech, and the right to bear arms.

In summary, the powers not given to the Federal government by the Constitution go to the states or the people, as they have significant authority over matters within their borders and retain certain fundamental rights and powers not delegated to the federal government.

Prompt: who came up with the first working periodic table
Ground truth: The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties. The most important event in its history occurred in 1869, when the table was published by Dmitri Mendeleev, who built upon earlier discoveries by scientists such as Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier and John Newlands, but who is nevertheless generally given sole credit for its development.
[0.168, 0.238, 0.083, 0.131, 0.563] Agent refined response: The first working periodic table was developed by Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, in 1869. Mendeleev was able to arrange elements in a logical and systematic order based on their properties, such as atomic weight and valence, by using the periodic law, which he discovered.

Mendeleev's periodic table was a major breakthrough in the field of chemistry, as it provided a simple and easy-to-understand way to organize and classify elements. Prior to Mendeleev's work, elements were listed in a haphazard manner, with no clear pattern or organization.

Mendeleev was able to create his periodic table by using a combination of empirical data and logical reasoning. He used empirical data from chemical reactions and experiments to determine the properties of elements, and then used logical reasoning to arrange them in a systematic order.

Mendeleev’s periodic table has undergone several revisions since its initial publication, but the basic structure and organization of the table have remained the same. It has become a fundamental tool in chemistry and has played a crucial role in the development of modern chemistry

Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.357, 0.405, 0.105, 0.202, 0.622] Agent refined response: The colonists had a problem with the Tea Act of 1773 because it was seen as another example of the British government imposing its will on the colonies without their consent. The Tea Act allowed the British East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonies, bypassing local merchants and middlemen. This hurt the business of local merchants, who were loyal to the colonies and had been involved in the tea trade for years.

The colonists felt that the Tea Act was a violation of their rights as British subjects, as it denied them the right to trade with whoever they chose. They also saw it as a tactic by the British government to exert greater control over the colonies and to tax them without their consent.

The colonists had already been frustrated by a series of taxes and restrictions imposed by the British government, including the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Townshend Acts. These measures had been met with resistance and protests from the colonists, who felt that they were being unfairly treated and that their rights as British subjects were being ignored.

The Tea Act was seen as the final st

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).
[0.378, 0.392, 0.129, 0.189, 0.651] Agent refined response: The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis, Egypt. It is estimated that the construction of the Great Pyramid began in 2580 BC during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu and took around 20 years to complete, with a workforce of around 100,000 skilled laborers.

The pyramid's original height was around 481 feet (147 meters), and it was originally covered in smooth white limestone. The pyramid's base measures around 756 feet (230 meters) on each side, and it consists of an estimated 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing around 2.5 tons.

The construction of the Great Pyramid is considered one of the greatest architectural and engineering achievements of all time, and it is believed that it was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu. The pyramid's precise construction techniques and the way it was aligned with the celestial bodies have been the subject of

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.353, 0.375, 0.120, 0.191, 0.644] Agent refined response: The secretory cells of endocrine organs secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The endocrine system is a network of glands and organs that produce and release hormones directly into the bloodstream to regulate various bodily functions. The secretory cells of endocrines glands, such as the pancreas, thyroid, adrenal glands, and pituitary gland, secrete their products into the bloodstream through tiny ducts or canals.

Once released into the bloodstream, hormones can travel to other parts of the body, where they can bind to specific receptors on the surface of cells, triggering a response or signal that helps regulate various bodily functions, such as growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive processes.

It is important to note that the endocrine system works in a feedback loop, meaning that hormone levels in the bloodstream can affect the secretion of other hormones, creating a complex interplay of hormone signals that help maintain homeostasis in the body.

Ground truth: The Beer Hall Putsch, also known as the Munich Putsch, and, in German, as the Hitlerputsch, Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch, Bürgerbräu-Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle, was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler--along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders--to seize power in Munich, Bavaria, during 8--9 November 1923. About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers. Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, Hitler was arrested and charged with treason.

Prompt: who said beware of the ides of march
Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone." This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the "seer" as a haruspex named Spurinna.

Prompt: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola
Ground truth: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador.

Prompt: who represents the insured in the investigation of a claim
Ground truth: Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.
[0.256, 0.317, 0.046, 0.163, 0.597] Agent refined response: The insured is represented by their insurance provider during the investigation of a claim. The insurance provider will assign an adjuster to investigate the claim and determine the extent of the coverage and the amount of compensation owed to the insured. The adjuster will gather evidence, interview witnesses, and assess the damages or losses incurred by the insured in order to make a determination.

In some cases, the insured may also have the option to hire a public adjuster to represent their interests during the claims process. A public adjuster is an independent professional who is hired by the insured to advocate on their behalf and help ensure that they receive the full amount of coverage to which they are entitled.

It is important for the insured to understand their rights and responsibilities during the claims process and to seek legal advice if necessary to ensure that their interests are protected.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.209, 0.279, 0.058, 0.171, 0.557] Agent refined response: A dieback or population crash in a species occurs when the population size decreases significantly and persistently over a prolonged period. The causes of a dieback or population crash can vary and may include:

1. Habitat loss or fragmentation: When a species' habitat is destroyed or broken into smaller pieces, it can lead to a decline in the population size as individuals are unable to find suitable habitats to live in.
2. Overexploitation: Overhunting, overfishing, or overharvesting of a species can lead to a decline in population size as individuals are removed from the population at a rate faster than they can reproduce.
3. Climate change: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can make it difficult for a species to survive, leading to a decline in population size.
4. Invasive species: The introduction of non-native species can lead to competition for resources and habitat, causing a decline in the population size of the native species.
5. Disease: The spread of disease can cause a significant decline in population size as individuals become sick and die.
6. Pollution: The introduction of pollutants into the environment can make

Prompt: what states do not allow daylight savings time
Ground truth: Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year, so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time (DST), the exceptions being Arizona (except for the Navajo, who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands), Hawaii, and the overseas territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US.

1. Hawaii: Hawaii is exempt from DST because it is located near the equator and does not experience a significant change in daylight hours throughout the year.
2. Arizona: Arizona also does not observe DST, except for the Navajo Nation, which does observe DST.

So, the two states that do not allow daylight saving time are Hawaii and Arizona.

Prompt: when did the nba add the three point line
Ground truth: In the 1979--80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.
[0.315, 0.333, 0.130, 0.256, 0.563] Agent refined response: The NBA introduced the three-point line in the 1979-1980 season. The league added the three-point line to create more scoring opportunities and to increase the pace of play. The three-point line was set at 23 feet, 9 inches from the basket, and shots made beyond that distance were worth three points. Since then, the distance of the three-point line has been adjusted several times, but the basic concept of rewarding three points for shots made from beyond a certain distance has remained the same.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.374, 0.335, 0.130, 0.213, 0.584] Agent refined response: The cones in the eye are located in the retina, which is the innermost layer of the eye. The retina contains two types of light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive to low light levels and are responsible for peripheral and night vision, while cones are responsible for color vision and high visual acuity.

There are three types of cones in the human retina, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light:

1. Long-wavelength cones (L-cones): These are sensitive to red light and are responsible for color perception in the red end of the spectrum (600-700 nanometers).
2. Middle-wavelength cones (M-cones): These are sensitive in the middle of the visual spectrum (500-600 nanometers) and are responsible for color perception of the green light.
3. Short-wavelength cones (S-cones): These are sensitive at the blue end of the spectrum (400-500 nanometers) and responsible for color perception of blue and vio

Prompt: who is the founder of el pollo loco
Ground truth: El Pollo Loco is the name of two independent restaurant chains that are controlled by different companies, El Pollo Loco, Inc. and El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. Both companies specialize in Mexican-style grilled chicken and were founded by Juan Francisco Ochoa. Ochoa established the first El Pollo Loco restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in the mid-1970s, and then expanded his chain into the United States in 1980. Ochoa then sold his U.S. restaurants in 1983, which became El Pollo Loco, Inc., while keeping the ones in Mexico, which became El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. Both companies have since occupied non-overlapping global territories, and have offered different fare.

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.371, 0.423, 0.108, 0.237, 0.617] Agent refined response: Connective tissue is found throughout the body and is an essential component of all organs and organ systems. It provides support, structure, and protection to the body's cells and organs, and also facilitates the transportation of nutrients, waste products, and other substances throughout the body.

Connective tissue is found in various forms, including:

1. Loose connective tissue: This type of connective tissue is found in the spaces between cells and organs, and provides a supportive framework for the body's structures. Examples of loose connective tissue include the spaces between muscle fibers, the spaces between blood vessels, and the spaces between nerve fibers.
2. Dense connective tissue: This type is found in areas where there is a high concentration of cells or organs, such as in the skin, bones, and cartilage. Dense connective tissue provides support and structure to these areas.
3. Adipose connective tissue: This is the fatty connective tissue found throughout the body, which provides insulation, cushioning, and energy storage.
4. Bone and cartilage

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.286, 0.362, 0.106, 0.162, 0.575] Agent refined response: According to popular belief, April Fools' Day officially ends at noon on April 1st. The idea behind this is that any pranks or jokes played after noon on April 1st are considered to be "late" or "after the deadline" and therefore not valid or effective. However, it's worth noting that this is simply a social convention and not an actual rule or law. Some people may choose to continue playing pranks or jokes after noon on April 1, and there's no one to stop them!

Prompt: name of black man in to kill a mockingbird
Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: where did the santa fe trail take emigrants
Ground truth: The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century transportation route through central North America that connected Independence, Missouri with Santa Fe, New Mexico. Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell, it served as a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to Santa Fe in 1880. Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro which carried trade from Mexico City.
[0.220, 0.332, 0.129, 0.213, 0.591] Agent refined response: The Santa Fe Trail was a 1,200-mile (1,900 km) historic route that connected Missouri to New Mexico during the mid-19th century. The trail was used by thousands of emigrants, including settlers, traders, and soldiers, who traveled to the West in search of land, wealth, and adventure.

The Santa Fe Trail originated in Independence, Missouri, and followed the Kansas River to Fort Leavenworth. From there, it headed southwest through present-day Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico, eventually reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico. The trail was established in the 1820s and was used extensively during the 1840s and 1850s, particularly after the Mexican-American War.

Emigrants who traveled the Santa Fe Trail faced numerous challenges, including harsh weather conditions, dangerous river crossings, and conflicts with Native American tribes. Despite these challenges, the trail played a significant role in the expansion of the United States, particularly in the development of the American West. Today, the Santa Fe Trail is a National Historic Trail and is recognized as

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.
[0.298, 0.358, 0.072, 0.172, 0.592] Agent refined response: Chocolate originated in Mesoamerica, specifically in the regions that are now Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. The earliest evidence of chocolate consumption comes from the Olmec civilization, which flourished in the region from about 1500 to 400 BCE. The Olmecs are believed to have cultivated the cacao tree, the main ingredient in chocolate, and to have used the beans to make a bitter, frothy drink that was believed to have medicinal and spiritual properties.

From Mesoamerica, chocolate spread to other parts of the Americas, including Central and South America, as well as to Spain and Asia through the Columbian Exchange, a transfer of plants, animals, and culture that occurred after Columbus's arrival in the Americas in 1492.

In Spain, chocolate became a popular drink among the nobility and was often consumed as a luxury item. It was also introduced to other parts of Europe, where it became popular as a fashionable and indulgent treat.

In Asia, chocolate was introduced by Spanish and Portuguese traders and mission

Prompt: the elements in each period have the same number of
Ground truth: A period in the periodic table is one of the horizontal rows, all of those elements have the same number of electron shells. Going across a period, each element has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. Arranged this way, groups of elements in the same column have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the alkali metals lie in the first column (group 1) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. As of 2016 a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed.
[0.321, 0.407, 0.150, 0.258, 0.615] Agent refined response: electrons.

In chemistry, the periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the elements, organized by their atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus), electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. The elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number (number of protons) and are grouped into rows called periods and columns called groups or families.

Each period in the periodic table represents a different energy level or electron shell, with the elements in each period having the same number of electrons in their outermost energy level or electron shell. This means that elements in the same period have similar chemical properties, such as reactivity with other elements, because they have the same number of valence electrons (electrons available to form bonds) and similar electron configurations.

For example, elements in the first period (such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium) have one electron in their outermost energy level, while elements in the second period (such as beryllium, boron, and carbon) have two electrons in their outermost energy level. Elements in the third period (such as nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine) have three electrons in their outermost energy level, and

[0.136, 0.235, 0.089, 0.137, 0.577] Agent refined response: The Bible does not use the term "taking the Lord's name in vain," but it does contain several passages that address the use of God's name in a disrespectful or irreverent manner. Here are a few examples:

1. Exodus 20:7 - "You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold guiltless anyone who misuses his name."
2. Leviticus 22:30 - "Do not profane my holy name, for I must be acknowledged as holy by the Israelites. I am the Lord who makes you holy."
3. Deuteronomy 5:11 - "You shall not misuse or profane my name, for I am the Lord."

In these passages, God emphasizes the importance of treating his name with reverence and respect. Using his name in a disrespectful manner is considered a sin, and those who do so are warned of God's judgment.

It's worth noting that the concept of "taking the Lord'sname in vain" is not a direct translation of any of these passages,

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.246, 0.347, 0.103, 0.254, 0.574] Agent refined response: According to the knowledge provided, the heart begins to develop around the 22nd day of embryonic development and begins pumping blood around the 28th day. Here is a breakdown of the heart's development and blood pumping process during embryonic development:

1. Heart development: The heart begins to develop around the 19th day of embryonic development as a tube-like structure called the primary heart field. This structure eventually folds in on itself to form the four-chambered heart.
2. Heart tube formation: By the 22nd day, the heart tube has formed, and the primordial chambers (the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles) are beginning to differentiate.
3. Blood circulation: By the 28th day, the heart is pumping blood through the embryo, with the blood flowing from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery and then to the lungs for oxygenation.
4. Blood flow reversal: After the heart begins pumping blood, the direction of blood flow reverses, with the blood flow

Prompt: where does decussation occur in the spinothalamic pathway
Ground truth: The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.
[0.206, 0.286, 0.112, 0.214, 0.604] Agent refined response: Decussation in the spinothalamic tract occurs at the level of the cerebral peduncle, which is the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres. The spinothalamic tract is a pathway that carries sensory information from the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain.

In the spinothalamic tract, the fibers from the right and left sides of the body cross over to the opposite side of the brain at the level of the cerebellum, a process known as decussation. This means that the fibers from the right side of the body terminate in the left hemisphere of the brain, and the fibers from the left side of the body terminate in the right hemisphere of the brain.

Decussation is essential for proper sensory processing, as it allows the brain to integrate sensory information from both sides of the body into a unified perception of the environment. For example, when you touch your left hand, the sensory information from that touch is processed in the right hemisphere of your brain, and vice versa.

It's worth noting that decussation is

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison. The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution, which replaced hanging. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling declaring existing capital punishment statutes unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972), New York was without a death penalty until 1995, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a new statute into law, which provided for execution by lethal injection.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.
[0.259, 0.269, 0.049, 0.159, 0.515] Agent refined response: The Virginia colony was established in 1607 and was one of the first successful English colonies in North America. The religion practiced by the colonists in Virginia was primarily Anglicanism, which was the official religion of the English colony.

The Virginia Company of London, which sponsored the settlement of the colony, was established as a joint-stock company with the purpose of spreading Christianity and establishing a profitable colony. As a result, the early colonists in Virginia were predominantly Anglicans, and the Church of England was the dominant religious institution in the colony.

However, it's worth noting that not all colonists were Anglicans. There were also Puritans, Catholics, and other religious groups present in the colony, particularly in the later years of its existence.

Here are some key dates and facts related to religion in the Virginia colony:

* 1607: The Virginia Company of London establishes the Jamestown settlement, which becomes the first permanent English colony in North America.
* 1608: The Virginia General Assembly passes a law making the Church of England the official religion of

Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism. Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.

This represents about 4.5% of the total U.S. public debt. It is essential to note that the U.S. government borrows money from various sources, including foreign governments, investors, and domestic sources, to finance its operations and fund its deficits.

China is the largest foreign creditor of America because it has been purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds for years to maintain its foreign exchange reserves. China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has been diversifying its foreign exchange reserves by investing in U.S. Treasuries to reduce its exposure to the U.S. dollar and other currencies.

Prompt: where does the term dog and pony show come from
Ground truth: The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show," started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "Gentry's Equine and Canine Paradox." It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).
[0.314, 0.411, 0.120, 0.182, 0.601] Agent refined response: The term "dog and pony show" originated in the late 19th century in the United States.

These acts were often used to entertain and distract the audience while the show's promoters would try to sell their products or services. Over time, the term "dog and pony show " became a colloquialism for any presentation or performance that was seen as insincere or manipulative, often used to describe political campaigns, advertising, or other forms of public relations.

Prompt: who is recognized as the founder of islam
Ground truth: According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.
[0.392, 0.408, 0.119, 0.276, 0.599] Agent refined response: The founder of Islam is Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). He was born in Mecca, Arabia in 570 CE and received his first revelation from Allah (God) through the angel Gabriel when he was 40 years old. Over the next 23 years, he received a series of revelations that were later compiled into the Quran, the holy book of Islam.

Muhammad's teachings emphasized the unity of God, the importance of social justice, and the equal treatment of all people, regardless of their race, gender, or social status. He also emphasized the importance of leading a righteous life, treating others with kindness and compassion, and performing acts of charity and good deeds.

Muhammad is considered by Muslims to be the last in a line of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and his teachings form the basis of Islam. He is revered by Muslims as the greatest of all prophets and is often referred to as the "Seal of the Prophets."

It is revealed later that Sasuke is the sole survivor of the once-powerful Uchiha clan of Konohagakure. He, at the age of seven, survived the massacre of his clan perpetrated by his brother, Itachi, who spared Sasuke's life because he did not consider him worth killing. Sasuke seeks strong fighting opponents to reassure himself his power is growing.
[0.271, 0.295, 0.041, 0.180, 0.569] Agent refined response: Sasuke Uchiha was born in the Third Great Ninja War, which took place 12 years before the start of the Naruto series. His father, Chiyo Uchiha, was killed during the war, and his mother, Mikoto Uchiha, was gravely injured.

Prompt: the origins of the stations of the cross
Ground truth: The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the Via Crucis, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic ones.

The stations are traditionally arranged in a specific order and are typically displayed in churches, homes, and other religious settings.

The origins of the stations of the Cross can be traced back to the early Christian Church, particularly in the Mediterranean region. The practice of meditating on the Passion of Christ through the stations of the cross became popular in the Middle Ages, particularly among the Franciscan Order. The Franciscans developed a standardized set of 14 stations, which were first used in the 13th century.

Prompt: when does a limit of a function not exist
Ground truth: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f (x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
[0.172, 0.197, 0.058, 0.146, 0.559] Agent refined response: A limit of a function does not exist when the function's value does not approach a specific value as the input (or independent variable) approaches a specific value. In other words, the limit of a function does not exist at a point where the function does not approach that point.

Here are some scenarios where the limit of a function does not exists:

1. The function has a vertical asymptote at that point: If a function has a vertical asymptote at a particular point, then the limit of the function as the input approaches that point does not exist.
2. The function has a discontinuity at that point: If a function is discontinuous at a particular point, then the function's limit does not exist at that point.
3. The function has a cusp at that point: If a function approaches infinity or negative infinity at a particular point, then the limt of the function as the input approaches does not exist.
4. The function has a horizontal asymptote at that point: If the function has a horizontal asymptote at a particular point, the limit of the function as the Input approaches that point does not exist. 

These are just a few examples of when the limit of a

Prompt: where does eye of the round roast come from
Ground truth: A round steak is a beef steak from the "round", the rear leg of the cow. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, with or without the "round" bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.
[0.310, 0.316, 0.097, 0.187, 0.571] Agent refined response: The term "eye of the round roast" is a culinary term used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It refers to the lean, tender portion of the round roast, which is located near the bone and is considered to be the most tender and flavorful part of the cut.

The term "eye" in this context refers to the area around the bone, where the meat is most tender and juicy. This area is often cut out and served as a separate dish, rather than being cooked as part of the larger roast.

The origin of the term "eye of the round" is not well-documented, but it is believed to have originated in the United States in the mid-20th century. It is possible that the term was coined by butchers or chefs who wanted to highlight the tenderness and flavor of this particular cut of meat.

In some cases, the term "eye of the roast" may also be used to refer to the tenderloin, which is a long, narrow muscle located near the bone in the round roast. However, the term "eye of round" is more

Prompt: where do bullets go when fired in the air
Ground truth: Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
[0.304, 0.341, 0.115, 0.209, 0.629] Agent refined response: Bullets fired in the air do not go anywhere; they simply disintegrate or fall back to the ground after a short time in the atmosphere. This is because the force of gravity pulls them downward, and they do not have enough momentum to continue flying.

The trajectory of a bullet fired in the air is determined by the angle of elevation and the air resistance it encounters. As the bullet rises, it experiences less air resistance, and its trajectory becomes more vertical. Eventually, the bullet reaches its peak height and begins to fall back to the ground due to gravity.

In summary, bullets fired in the air do not travel long distances and do not pose a significant threat to people or property on the ground.

Prompt: where does the saying keeping up with the jones come from
Ground truth: The phrase originates with the comic strip Keeping Up with the Joneses, created by Arthur R. "Pop" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in The New York World and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were unseen characters throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom keeping up with the Joneses has remained popular long after the strip's end.
[0.280, 0.356, 0.130, 0.227, 0.585] Agent refined response: The saying "Keeping up with the Joneses" originated in the late 19th century in the United States. It refers to the idea of keeping up with one's neighbors or peers in terms of material possessions, social status, or lifestyle. The phrase is often used to describe the pressure to conform to societal standards of success and wealth, and the anxiety that comes with feeling like one is falling behind.

The term "Joneses" is believed to have been coined by the American humorist and writer, James Thurber, in his 1938 short story "The Joneses." Thurber's story follows a couple who are constantly trying to keep up with their wealthy neighbors, the Joneses, and the various absurd and humorous situations that ensue.

Since then, the phrase "Keeping up with the Joneseses" has become a common idiom in American English, used to describe the competitive and consumerist culture of the post-World War II era. It is often used to criticize the excesses of capitalism and the pressure to conform to societal expectations of success and material wealth.

Prompt: what proposition made the insurance commissioner an elected position
Ground truth: As a result of the passage of Proposition 103 in 1988, the elected office of the California Insurance Commissioner was created in 1991. Previously, the position was held by a person appointed by the Governor. The Insurance Commissioner oversees the Department of Insurance. Democrat Dave Jones won the November 2, 2010 election for California Insurance Commissioner.
[0.215, 0.339, 0.139, 0.239, 0.609] Agent refined response: The proposition that made the insurance commissioner an appointed position in some states is Proposition 103, which was passed in California in 1988. This proposition, also known as the "Insurance Commissioner Election Act," changed the way the insurance commissioner was elected in California by making the position an elected one instead of an appointed one.

Prior to Proposition 103, the insurance commissioner in California was appointed by the Governor. However, Proposition 103 amended the California Constitution to provide that the insurance commissioner would be elected by the voters, beginning with the 1990 election.

Proposition 103 was passed in response to concerns that the insurance industry had too much influence over the commissioner's actions and that the position was not adequately representing the interests of consumers.

Prompt: where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created
Ground truth: The pars distalis, (distal part), comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.
[0.209, 0.265, 0.083, 0.210, 0.568] Agent refined response: The hormones of the anterior pitutyary are created in the cells of the anterior pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. The anterior pituitary gland is responsible for producing several important hormones that regulate various bodily functions, including growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive function.

The process of hormone production in the anterior pituitary glands involves several steps:

1. Transcription: The first step in hormone production is transcription, which is the process of converting DNA into RNA. In the anterior pituitary gand, specific genes are activated, and their corresponding mRNA is transcribed into hormone precursors.
2. Processing: The hormone precursors are then processed and modified to form the mature hormone. This involves several enzymatic reactions and the removal of non-essential amino acids.
3. Secretion: The mature hormones are then secreted from the anterior pituitary ganda into the bloodstream.

Some of the hormones produced by the anterior pituitary

[0.201, 0.237, 0.060, 0.119, 0.522] Agent refined response: The first vaccine for whooping cough, also known as pertussis, was developed in the late 19th century. The first pertussis vaccine was developed by Edward Jenner in 1885, and it was made from a weakened form of the bacteria that causes the disease. However, the vaccine was not widely used until the 1940s, when a more effective vaccine was developed by a team of scientists led by Thomas Huckle Weller. This vaccine, known as the DTP vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis), was first introduced in the United States in the 1940s and has been used widely around the world since then.

Since then, there have been several advancements in pertussis vaccine technology, including the development of acellular vaccines, which do not contain any whole bacteria and are considered to be safer and more effective than the earlier whole-cell vaccines. Today, pertussis vaccines are an important part of childhood immunization programs around the world, and they have helped to

Prompt: to whom do the powers not given to the federal government by the constitution go
Ground truth: The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people.
[0.244, 0.331, 0.167, 0.244, 0.630] Agent refined response: The knowledge you are seeking is related to the distribution of power between the federal government and the states in the United States. According to the US Constitution, the federal government has certain powers that are explicitly granted to it by the Constitution, while other powers are reserved for the states or the people.

Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution lists the specific powers granted to the federal government, including the power to coin money, regulate commerce, declare war, and make treaties. However, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution states that any powers not explicitly granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the People.

Therefore, the powers not given to the federal governments by the Constitution go to the states or the people. This means that the states have significant autonomy and authority over matters within their respective jurisdictions, such as education, law enforcement, and natural resources management.

In summary, the powers not given to the Federal government by the Constitution go to the states, and the people.

Ground truth: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.

Prompt: who came up with the first working periodic table
Ground truth: The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties. The most important event in its history occurred in 1869, when the table was published by Dmitri Mendeleev, who built upon earlier discoveries by scientists such as Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier and John Newlands, but who is nevertheless generally given sole credit for its development.
[0.301, 0.327, 0.124, 0.177, 0.563] Agent refined response: The first working periodic table was developed by Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, in 1869. Mendeleev was able to arrange elements in a logical and systematic order based on their properties, such as atomic weight and valence, by using the periodic law, which he discovered. He also predicted the existence of several elements that were not yet known at the time and left gaps in the table for them. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been refined and expanded to include all known elements.

Prompt: communities of similar organisms found in a particular environment are called
Ground truth: In ecology, a habitat is the kind of natural environment in which a particular species of organism lives. It is characterized by both physical and biological features. A species' habitat is those places where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction.
[0.126, 0.194, 0.020, 0.117, 0.555] Agent refined response: Ecosystems.

Communities of similar organisms found within a particular environment are called ecosystems. An ecosystem is a community of living and non-living things, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, interacting with each other and their environment. Ecosystems can be found in various environments, including forests, grasslands, deserts, oceans, and even urban areas.

Each ecosystem has its unique characteristics, including the types of organisms that live there, the availability of resources such as water and nutrients, and the physical environment such as temperature, light, and topography. The interactions between organisms and their environment are complex and dynamic, with organisms adapting to their environment and influencing it in turn.

Understanding ecosystems is important for conservation and management of natural resources, as well as for addressing environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. By studying ecosystems, scientists can gain insights into how ecosystems function, how they respond to disturbances, and how they can be managed to maintain their health and resilience.

Prompt: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773
Ground truth: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.
[0.352, 0.385, 0.097, 0.199, 0.611] Agent refined response: The colonists had a problem with the Tea Act of 1773 because it was seen as an attempt by the British government to exert greater control over the colonies and to tax them without their consent. The Tea Act allowed the British East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonies, bypassing local merchants and middlemen, which hurt the local economy and angered the colonists. They saw it as another example of tyranny and oppression by the British government, which had already imposed a number of taxes and restrictions on the colonies without their consent.

The Tea Act was passed in 1773, and it led to the Boston Tea Party, where a group of colonists disguised as Native Americans boarded a British ship and threw its cargo of tea into the harbor to protest the tax. This event escalated tensions between the colonists and the British government, leading to the American Revolutionary War.

In summary, the colonists had a problem with the tea act of1773 because it was a symbol of British tyranny and oppression, and it hurt the local economy.

Prompt: how long did it take to build the great pyramid of egypt
Ground truth: Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).
[0.355, 0.353, 0.105, 0.187, 0.625] Agent refined response: The Great Pyramid of Giza took around 20 to 30 years to build, with a workforce of around 100,000 skilled laborers. The construction of the pyramid began during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops) around 2580 BC and was completed during the reign of Pharaoh Djedefre (also known as Chephren) around 2503 BC.

The pyramid was built using limestone and granite blocks, some of which weighed as much as 2.5 tons. The pyramid's original height was around 481 feet (147 meters), making it the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years until the Lincoln Cathedral was built in 1311 AD.

It is estimated that around 2.3 million stone blocks were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid, each block cut from limestone bedrock using copper tools and then transported to the construction site using ramps and pulleys. The pyramid's base covers an area of around

Prompt: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Ground truth: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products--bile and pancreatic juice--into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.
[0.330, 0.364, 0.064, 0.166, 0.630] Agent refined response: The secretory cells of endocrine organs secrete their products into the bloodstream. These cells, known as endocrine cells, are found in various organs throughout the body, including the pancreas, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and gonads (ovaries and testes).

The secretory cells of endocrine organ produce and release hormones into the bloodstream, which are then carried to other parts of the body where they can affect various physiological processes. Hormones are chemical messengers that help regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, growth and development, and reproductive processes.

For example, the pancreas produces insulin and glucagon hormones, which help regulate blood sugar levels. The thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism and growth. The adrenal glands produce hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which help regulate stress response and other physiological processes.

In summary, the secretory cells of endocrinal glands secrete their products into the blood stream, which are then carried to other part of

Prompt: where did the cosbys live in new york
Ground truth: The show focuses on the Huxtable family, an upper middle-class African-American family, living in a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, New York, at 10 Stigwood Avenue. The patriarch is Cliff Huxtable, an obstetrician and son of a prominent jazz trombonist. The matriarch is his wife, attorney Clair Huxtable.
[0.201, 0.222, 0.067, 0.144, 0.547] Agent refined response: The Cosby family, the fictional characters from the popular TV show "The Cosby Show," did not actually live in New York. The show was set in the fictional town of Huxtable, New York, which is likely based on the real-life town of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where Bill Cosby, the show's creator and star, lived for many years.

In the show, the Huxtable family lived in a large house on Kingston Avenue in the fictional town of Huxtartable. The house was actually a soundstage set built on the Universal Studios lot in California, rather than a real-life location in New York.

So while the Cosby family may have lived in New York, the actual location of their home was not in any real-life New York location.

Ground truth: In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, "The Ides of March are come", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied "Aye, Caesar; but not gone."

Prompt: where do you get male pattern baldness from
Ground truth: Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.
[0.123, 0.230, 0.095, 0.168, 0.591] Agent refined response: Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition in which men experience hair loss due to genetic factors. It is caused by the presence of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is a potent form of testosterone that is produced by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in the hair follicles.

Researchers believe that DHT causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to a gradual reduction in hair growth and eventual hair loss. This condition is inherited from one's parents, and the risk of developing male pattern baldness increases with age.

Other factors that may contribute to male pattern baldness include:

1. Family history: If your parents or grandparents experienced hair loss, you may be more likely to develop the condition.
2. Hormonal imbalances: Abnormal levels of androgens, such as DHT, can lead to hair loss.
3. Stress: Prolonged periods of stress can cause hair loss in some people.
4. Poor diet: A diet lacking essential nutrients

Prompt: who represents the insured in the investigation of a claim
Ground truth: Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.
[0.246, 0.308, 0.106, 0.211, 0.620] Agent refined response: An insurance adjuster represents the insured in the investigation and settlement of an insurance claim. They are employed by the insurance company to investigate the claim, assess the damages, and determine the extent of the insurer's liability. The adjuster will gather evidence, interview witnesses, and evaluate medical records to determine the validity of the claim.

Insurance adjusters are trained professionals who are skilled in the investigation and analysis of insurance claims. They use their knowledge and experience to determine the facts of the case and make recommendations to the insurance company regarding the settlement of the claim.

It is important to note that the insurance adjuster is not the same as the insurance agent or broker who sold the policy to the insured. The agent or broker represents the insurance company and is responsible for marketing and selling insurance policies to customers.

In summary, the insurance adjuster represents the insurer in the investigation and settlement of an injury claim, while the insurance agent or broker represents the insurer in marketing and selling insurance products to customers.

Prompt: what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries
Ground truth: The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.
[0.091, 0.243, 0.045, 0.126, 0.518] Agent refined response: The Grim Reaper is a symbol of death and does not actually carry a weapon. However, in some depictions, the Grim Reaper is sometimes shown carrying a scythe, which is a curved blade used for mowing grass or cutting crops. The scythe has been adopted as a symbol of the Grim Reaper's tool of death, representing the idea of cutting down life.

Prompt: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Ground truth: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot-and-collapse '.
[0.218, 0.301, 0.061, 0.165, 0.561] Agent refined response: Dieback or population crash occurs when a species' population declines by more than 70% in a short period, usually less than 10 years. This event is also known as a population crash or a mass extinction.

There are several reasons why a dieback or population crash may occur, including:

1. Habitat loss or fragmentation: When a species' habitat is destroyed or broken into smaller pieces, it can lead to a decline in the population.
2. Overexploitation: Overhunting or overharvesting of a species can cause a population decline.
3. Climate change: As temperatures rise, some species may struggle to adapt and survive.
4. Invasive species: The introduction of non-native species can lead to competition for resources and habitat, causing a decline in the population of the native species.
5. Disease: Diseases can spread quickly among a population, causing a significant decline in numbers.
6. Pollution: Pollution can have a negative impact on a species' health and reproduction, leading to a decline in the population over time.

Prompt: what are the 3 layers of the meninges
Ground truth: The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/, singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or/ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ, translit. mēninx, lit. ' membrane ', adjectival: meningeal/məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
[0.378, 0.404, 0.199, 0.305, 0.569] Agent refined response: The meninges are three layers of protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The three layers of meninges are:

1. Dura mater: The outermost layer of meninges, the dura mater is a thick, fibrous membrane that attaches to the inside of the skull and the vertebral bones.
2. Arachnoid mater: The middle layer of meninges, the arachnoid mater is a delicate, web-like membrane that is loosely attached to the dura mater.
3. Pia mater: The innermost layer of meninges, the pia mater is a thin, delicate membrane that closely adheres to the surface of the brain and spinal cord.

Each of these layers plays a vital role in protecting the brain and spinal cord from injury and infection, as well as facilitating the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the brain and the bloodstream.

Prompt: where are the cones in the eye located
Ground truth: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.
[0.416, 0.376, 0.135, 0.210, 0.607] Agent refined response: The cones in the eye are located in the retina, which is the innermost layer of the eye. The retina contains two types of light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are more numerous than cones and are responsible for peripheral and night vision, while cones are responsible for color vision and central vision.

There are three types of cones in the human retina, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light:

1. Long-wavelength cones (L-cones): These cones are sensitive to red light and are responsible for red-green color vision.
2. Middle-wavelength cones (M-cones): These cones respond to light with wavelengths in the middle of the visible spectrum, including green light.
3. Short-wavelength cones (S-cones): These cones detect light with short wavelengths, such as blue and violet light.

The cones are located in the fovea, a small area in the center of the retina that is responsible for sharp, central vision. The cones in the fovea are

Prompt: where is connective tissue found in the body
Ground truth: Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
[0.328, 0.394, 0.147, 0.226, 0.584] Agent refined response: Connective tissue is found throughout the body and supports, connects, and holds other tissues and organs together. It is found in the following locations:

1. Bones: Connective tissue in bones, such as bone marrow, helps to produce blood cells and provides a framework for the bone.
2. Blood vessels: Connective tissue in blood vessels, such as the walls of arteries and veins, helps to transport blood throughout the body.
3. Brain and spinal cord: Connective tissue in the brain and spinal cord, such as meninges, helps to protect and support these delicate tissues.
4. Heart: Connective tissue in the heart, such as the heart valves, helps to regulate blood flow through the heart.
5. Lungs: Connective tissue in the lungs, such as the alveoli, helps to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide through the process of respiration.
6. Liver: Connective tissue in the liver, such as the liver capsule, helps to filter blood and remove toxins from the body.

Prompt: where do pineapples come from in the world
Ground truth: Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in five to ten months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest. In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
[0.230, 0.293, 0.090, 0.178, 0.559] Agent refined response: Pineapples are native to South America, specifically the tropical regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and southern Argentina. They are a member of the bromeliad family and were first domesticated by the indigenous people of South America over 3,000 years ago.

The first recorded European discovery of pineapples was by Christopher Columbus in 1493, when he encountered them on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. From there, pineapples were introduced to other parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and Europe, where they became a popular fruit. Today, pineapples are grown in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including Hawaii, Costa Rica, and the Philippines.

Prompt: when does april fools day end at noon
Ground truth: In Poland, prima aprilis ("1 April" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes--sometimes very sophisticated--are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.
[0.367, 0.359, 0.085, 0.191, 0.555] Agent refined response: April Fool's Day is a day celebrated on April 1st every year. It is a day where people play practical jokes and pranks on each other. The day is believed to have originated in the 16th century and has since become a popular tradition in many countries around the world.

There is no specific time when April Fool's Day ends, as it is a day-long celebration that lasts from midnight to midnight on April 1st. However, some people may choose to end their April Fool's Day pranks at noon or another specific time.

It is important to note that April Fool's Day prank can be fun and light-hearted, but it is important to be respectful and considerate of others' feelings and to avoid playing pranks that may be hurtful or offensive to others.

Prompt: where is thank you for your service based
Ground truth: Thank You for Your Service is a 2017 American biographical war drama film written and directed by Jason Hall, in his directorial debut, based on the 2013 non-fiction book of the same name by David Finkel. Finkel, a Washington Post reporter, wrote about veterans of the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment returning to the vicinity of Fort Riley, Kansas, following a 15-month deployment in Iraq in 2007. The film is about posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depicting U.S. soldiers who try to adjust to civilian life, and stars Miles Teller, Haley Bennett, Beulah Koale, Amy Schumer and Scott Haze. A new Bruce Springsteen song, "Freedom Cadence", was written specifically for the closing credits.
[0.247, 0.237, 0.051, 0.186, 0.455] Agent refined response: Thank you for your service is a phrase commonly used to express gratitude and appreciation towards individuals who have served in the military or have been involved in some form of service. The phrase is often used to acknowledge and honor the sacrifices and contributions made by these individuals, and is a way of showing respect and appreciation for their service.

The phrase "Thank you for your service" is commonly used in the United States, particularly during military appreciation events, parades, and other patriotic gatherings. It is also used in various forms of media, such as in news articles, social media posts, and advertisements.

In terms of where the phrase is based, it is likely that it originated in the United States, as the country has a long history of military service and a strong culture of appreciation for those who serve. However, the phrase is not unique to the United States and is also used in other countries with similar cultures and traditions.

Prompt: what is the approximate volume of the brain
Ground truth: Studies on human brain size, largely based on participants of European ancestry, tend to find an average adult brain volume of 1260 cubic centimeters (cm) for men and 1130 cm for women. There is, however, substantial variation between individuals; one study of 46 adults, aged 22--49 years and of mainly European descent, found an average brain volume of 1273.6 cm for men, with a range of 1052.9 to 1498.5 cm, and 1131.1 cm for women, with a range of 974.9 to 1398.1 cm.
[0.306, 0.295, 0.092, 0.182, 0.532] Agent refined response: The average adult human brain weighs around 1.4 kilograms (kg) or 3 pounds (lb) and has a volume of approximately 1,300-1,400 cubic centimeters (cm3) (Roland et al., 2017).

However, it is important to note that brain volume can vary slightly between individuals, and there is considerable overlap between the ranges of different studies. Additionally, brain volume can change throughout life due to various factors such as age, sex, genetics, and disease.

Prompt: name of black man in to kill a mockingbird
Ground truth: Thomas "Tom" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life-a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters.

Prompt: where did the santa fe trail take emigrants
Ground truth: The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century transportation route through central North America that connected Independence, Missouri with Santa Fe, New Mexico. Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell, it served as a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to Santa Fe in 1880. Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro which carried trade from Mexico City.
[0.200, 0.296, 0.133, 0.222, 0.584] Agent refined response: The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century emigrant route used by Americans and Europeans to travel westward, primarily to the Kansas Territory and the Southwest, including New Mexico Territory. The trail was established in 1821 and was used for 25 years before the construction of the railroad.

The trail began in Independence, Missouri, and ended in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was about 700 miles long and took emigrants through various terrain, including forests, deserts, and mountains. The trail was used by thousands of emigrants, including settlers, traders, and soldiers, who were seeking to establish new homes in the West.

Prompt: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Ground truth: The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century, when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.
[0.332, 0.393, 0.115, 0.186, 0.594] Agent refined response: Chocolate originated in Central America, in the region that is now known as Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of chocolate consumption comes from the Olmec civilization, which flourished in the region from about 1500 to 400 BCE. The Olmecs are believed to have cultivated the cacao tree, the main ingredient in chocolate, and to have used the beans to make a bitter, frothy drink that was believed to have medicinal and spiritual properties.

From Mesoamerica, chocolate spread to other parts of the Americas, including Mexico and South America. The Mayans and Aztecs, who lived in these regions, also prized chocolate and used it in religious rituals.

Chocolate was introduced to Europe by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century. It became popular in Spain and eventually spread to other parts of Europe, where it was used to make sweeter, more refined versions of the drink.

Asia also has a long history of chocolate consumption, dating back to the 16th century when Spanish missionaries introduced the drink to the Philippines.

Prompt: the elements in each period have the same number of
Ground truth: A period in the periodic table is one of the horizontal rows, all of those elements have the same number of electron shells. Going across a period, each element has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. Arranged this way, groups of elements in the same column have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the alkali metals lie in the first column (group 1) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. As of 2016 a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed.
[0.321, 0.408, 0.149, 0.232, 0.605] Agent refined response: electrons.

In the periodic table, the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus). Each element in a period has the same number of electrons in its outermost energy level (valence shell). This is because the number of electrons in the outermost energy level is determined by the atomic number of the element, and all elements in a period have the same atomic number.

For example, in the first period, the elements hydrogen (H), helium (He), and lithium (Li) have one electron in their outermost energy level, while the elements in the second period, such as beryllium (Be), boron (B), and carbon (C), have two electrons in their outermost energy level. This pattern continues throughout the periodic table, with each period having the same number of electrons in its inner energy levels and a different number of electrons in its outermostenergy level.

This periodic trend is important in understanding the properties and behavior of elements, as it determines the number of electrons available for bonding and other chemical reactions.

The season received mixed to positive critical responses while receiving several awards and nominations, including winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress--Series, Miniseries or Television Film for Cattrall. The season averaged over 7 million viewers.
[0.173, 0.185, 0.033, 0.139, 0.443] Agent refined response: The fifth season of Sex and the City has eight episodes because the show's creators, Darren Star and Michael Patrick King, intentionally kept the season short to maintain the show's quality and avoid diluting the storylines.

In an interview with The New York Times, King explained that the decision to limit the season to eight episodes was made to ensure that each episode was "like a little movie." He said, "We wanted to make sure that every episode was a real event, and that it was worth people's time to watch."

Additionally, the show's producers wanted to avoid the common problem of "seaon creep," where a show's episode count grows longer and longer as the seasons progress, leading to weaker storytelling and character development. By keeping the season short, the creators of Sex and the City were able to maintain a tight focus on the characters and their relationships, which was a key element of the show's success.

Overall, the decision to make only eight episodes in the fifth season of Sex and the City was a deliberate choice made by the show's creators to maintain the show's quality, focus, and impact.

Prompt: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood
Ground truth: Heart development refers to the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
[0.239, 0.331, 0.058, 0.198, 0.590] Agent refined response: The heart begins to develop around the fifth week of embryonic development, and it starts pumping blood around the third week after fertilization.

The heart is a vital organ that pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs. The heart is a muscular organ that beats approximately 100,000 times per day and pumps around 2,000 gallons of blood every day.

The heart develops from the third and fourth pharyngeal arches, which are structures that form in the embryo and eventually give rise to the face, neck, and other parts of the body. The heart begins to form around the fifth week of embryonal development, when the third and fourth pharynceal arches start to fold inward and fuse together.

The heart starts to beat around the third week after fertilisation, when the embryo undergoes a process called cardiac differentiation. During this process, the cells of the developing heart begin to specialize and organize into different layers, including the epicardium (the outer layer), the myocardium (the

Prompt: where does decussation occur in the spinothalamic pathway
Ground truth: The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.
[0.260, 0.350, 0.164, 0.256, 0.625] Agent refined response: Decussation refers to the crossing of nerve fibers from one side of the body to the other via the corpus callosum. The spinothalamic pathway is a major pathway that carries sensory information from the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain. Decussation occurs in the spinothalamic tract, which is a part of the spinothalamic pathways.

The spinothalamic tract is a bundle of nerve fibers that carries sensory information from sensory receptors in the body, such as skin, muscles, and joints, to the thalamus in  the brain. The tract is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and extends up to the medial part of the thalamus.

During development, the nerve fibers in the spinothalamic  tract cross over from one side of the body to  the other via the corpus callosa, resulting in a decussation of the tract. This crossing of nerve fibers allows for more efficient communication between the sensory receptors in the  body and the brain.

Prompt: when did new york stop using the electric chair
Ground truth: Capital punishment is not in force in the State of New York. The last execution took place in 1963, when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison. The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution, which replaced hanging. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling declaring existing capital punishment statutes unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972), New York was without a death penalty until 1995, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a new statute into law, which provided for execution by lethal injection.
[0.358, 0.404, 0.142, 0.225, 0.641] Agent refined response: New York State abolished the death penalty in 1972, which means that the electric chair was no longer used in the state after that year.

Before the abolition of the death penalty, New York had used the electric chair as a means of execution since 1890. The state's last execution by electrocution was in 1963, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for espionage.

After the Rosenbergs' execution, there were no more executions in New York, and the state's death penalty was effectively abolished. While the state's law still allows for the death penalty in certain circumstances, no one has been executed in New York since 1963, and the state has not carried out any executions since then.

Prompt: what was the religion in the virginia colony
Ground truth: In the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.
[0.311, 0.297, 0.054, 0.183, 0.533] Agent refined response: The religion in the Virginia colony was predominantly Christianity, with the majority of the colonists being Anglicans. The Virginia Company of London, which established the colony in 1607, was composed of English Protestants who sought to establish a Christian commonwealth in the New World. The company's charter explicitly stated that the colony's purpose was to spread Christianity and to establish a stable and prosperous society based on Christian principles.

However, it is important to note that not all colonists were members of the established Church of England. Some colonists were Puritans, who sought to separate themselves from the established church and to create a more pure and pure form of Christianity. Others were Catholics, who faced significant discrimination and persecution in the colony.

Overall, the religion in the Virginia colony was diverse and complex, reflecting the broader religious conflicts and tensions that existed in early modern Europe.

Prompt: when was the biltmore house opened to the public
Ground truth: In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism. Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.
[0.259, 0.355, 0.075, 0.182, 0.548] Agent refined response: The Biltmore House, the largest privately-owned home in the United States, was opened to the public in 1895 by George Vanderbilt. The house was built between 1889 and 1895 in Asheville, North Carolina, and it was designed by the architect Richard Morris Hunt. The estate was opened to the public as a way to showcase the house and its gardens, which were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the famous landscape architect. Today, the Biltmore Estate is open to the public and attracts over 1 million visitors each year.
